Municipal     institutions   and   companies       shall   advertise    vacancies      in  accord   with  the
principal rules of the City of Reykjavík. The principle of fairness shall be maintained
during    the   hiring   process.     The    choice    of  candidate      should     be   based    upon   the
competence of the applicant to perform the work of the advertised post. In making the
appointment, account shall be taken of the City’s equal rights programme and cultural
diversity policy. Fairness shall be maintained at the job interview, and the appointment
shall be made in a formal manner. New staff shall receive information on the municipal
system as applicable in each case.

The following
steps should be taken when formulating HR policies.

     Formulating HR policies
     1.   Gain understanding of the corporate culture and its shared values.
     2.   Analyse existing policies – written and unwritten. HR policies will exist in any
          organization, even if they are implicit rather than expressed formally.
     3.   Analyse external influences. HR policies are subject to the influence of UK employ-
          ment legislation, EC employment regulations, and the official Codes of Practice
          issued by bodies in the UK, such as ACAS (The Advisory, Conciliation and
          Arbitration Service), the EOC (Equal Opportunities Commission), the CRR
          (Commission on Racial Relations) and the HSE (Health and Safety Executive). The
          Codes of Practice issued by relevant professional institutions, such as the CIPD,
          should also be consulted.
     4.   Assess    any    areas   where     new     policies    are   needed     or   existing    policies   are
          inadequate.
     5.   Check with managers, preferably starting at the top, on their views about HR poli-
          cies and where they think they could be improved.
     6.   Seek the views of employees about the HR policies, especially the extent to which
          they are inherently fair and equitable and are implemented fairly and consistently.
          Consider doing this through an attitude survey.
     7.   Seek the views of union representatives.
     8.   Analyse the information obtained in the first seven steps and prepare draft
          policies.
     9.   Consult, discuss and agree policies with management and union representatives.
     10. Communicate the policies with guidance notes on their implementation as required
          (although they should be as self-explanatory as possible). Supplement this com-
          munication with training.            998     HR Policies, Procedures and Systems

           Implementing HR policies
           The aim will be to implement policies fairly and consistently. Line managers have an impor-
           tant role in doing this. As pointed out by Purcell et al (2003) ‘there is a need for HR policies to
           be designed for and focused on front line managers’. It is they who will be largely responsible
           for policy implementation. Members of the HR function can give guidance, but it is line man-
           agers who are on the spot and have to make decisions about people.

Introduction
HR policies are continuing guidelines on how people should be managed in the organization.
They define the philosophies and values of the organization on how people should be treated,
and from these are derived the principles upon which managers are expected to act when
dealing with HR matters. HR policies should be distinguished from procedures, as discussed
in Chapter 61. A policy provides generalized guidance on how HR issues should be dealt with;
a procedure spells out precisely what steps should be taken to deal with major employment
issues such as grievances, discipline, capability and redundancy.

Why have HR policies?
HR policies provide guidelines on how key aspects of people management should be handled.
The aim is to ensure that any HR issues are dealt with consistently in accordance with the
values of the organization in line with certain defined principles. All organizations have HR
policies. Some, however, exist implicitly as a philosophy of management and an attitude to
employees that is expressed in the way in which HR issues are handled; for example, the intro-
duction of new technology. The advantage of explicit policies in terms of consistency and
understanding may appear to be obvious, but there are disadvantages: written policies can be
inflexible, constrictive, platitudinous, or all three. To a degree, policies have often to be
expressed in abstract terms and managers do not care for abstractions. But they do want to
know where they stand – people like structure – and formalized HR policies can provide the
guidelines they need.
Formalized HR policies can be used in induction, team leader and management training to
help participants understand the philosophies and values of the organization and how they are
expected to behave within that context. They are a means for defining the employment rela-
tionship and the psychological contract.
HR policies can be expressed formally as overall statements of the values of the organization
or in specific areas, as discussed in this chapter.

Overall HR policy
The overall HR policy defines how the organization fulfils its social responsibilities to its
employees and sets out its attitudes towards them.

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
4.1.   Policy Objective
       The objective of the performance management policy is to promote and facilitate a culture of
       high performance that would drive the attainment of corporate goals. The policy is designed
       to ensure continuous support for employees towards enhancing and strengthening their
       performance, and to promote objective assessment of performance as a basis for learning
       and development, career development and rewards. The goals of Employee Performance
       Management at IHVN are to:
              a) Develop a method for measuring individual performance;
              b) Align corporate and individual performance goals, standards, and expectations;
              c) Develop an objective process for reviewing and improving employee performance;
              d) Provide an objective basis for rewarding commendable performance and managing
                   poor performance;
              e) Maintain an efficient, effective, and motivated workforce.

4.1.1. Policy Statements
     4.1.1.1.    IHVN aims to operate a performance management system where employees know
                 what needs to be achieved, what is required of them within specific timeframes, what
                 is measured, and what progress is being made.
     4.1.1.2.    The Institute’s resources and efforts must be aligned, focusing effort in the right
                 places and delivering maximum value towards the achievement of strategic goals.
     4.1.1.3.    The Institute’s strategic objectives should cascade down to employees in a way that
                 clearly connects individual goals to the corporate plan. To be effective, employees
                 must understand how their work contributes to the success of the Institute.
     4.1.1.4.    All employees are responsible for the implementation and administration of the
                 performance management process. Each employee at every level of the organization
                 must be held accountable for their participation in the process.
     4.1.1.5.    Management is also obligated to provide sufficient resources for the development of
                 supervisors in the essential components of employee performance management.
     4.1.1.6.    Employee performance appraisal must be based in clear, objective, job-related
                 criteria, predefined and agreed by supervisor and employee.
     4.1.1.7.    The performance management policy shall apply to all employees of the Institute.

                                                                                                       39 | P a g e 4.1.2. Guiding Principles
     4.1.2.1.

Workplace safety is a critical aspect of employee well-being and operational efficiency. Employees are required to adhere to safety policies, procedures, and standards while performing their job duties. The Institute regularly reviews and updates these safety policies, especially in response to major operational changes or legislative updates, ensuring that all changes are communicated to employees.

In the event of an accident, employees must report any personal injuries or near misses to their supervisors immediately and complete the Accident Book. If an employee is absent due to a work-related injury, they must fill out a self-certification form detailing the nature and cause of their injuries.

Personal safety is emphasized, with recommendations to avoid working alone when possible and to report any dangerous situations to supervisors. Employees are also encouraged to familiarize themselves with health and safety arrangements and to report any unsafe conditions.

The Institute has established guidelines for maintaining a safe, smoke-free, and drug-free workplace, prohibiting smoking inside buildings and ensuring that employees are fit for work, free from the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Overall, the responsibility for maintaining a safe work environment lies with both the organization and its employees, with clear procedures in place for reporting hazards and managing emergencies.","The principles of human resource policies, as outlined in the document, are:

1. **Respect for the individual**: Institutions and companies should respect their staff and their views.
2. **Collaboration and flexibility**: Encourage teamwork and adaptability in the workplace.
3. **Equality**: Promote fairness and equal rights among all employees.
4. **Knowledge and initiative**: Offer opportunities for staff to develop their knowledge and skills.
5. **Service mentality**: Prioritize a high standard of quality and service in all operations.

These principles guide how the City of Reykjavík manages its human resources, ensuring a competent and motivated workforce.",human_resource_policies.pdf_1 and 60 - HR Politicies.pdf_12 and 60 - HR Politicies.pdf_1 and IHVN-HR-Policy-Manual-Final-PCL.pdf_41,2024-09-16 14:55:19

Pay Equity Act
The goal of the Act is to correct salary differences due to
gender discrimination. Companies with 10 employees or more
must make sure there is pay equity between jobs done by
women and comparable jobs done by men. The Commission
des normes, de l’équité, de la santé et de la sécurité du travail
(CNESST or Labour Standards, Pay Equity and Workplace
Health and Safety Board) is in charge, amongst other things, of
applying the Act respecting labour standards and informing the
public about workplace rules.

Protection of Personal Information in the

Private Sector
The Act covers private sector employers and regulates the
protection of personal information that an employer collects,
holds, uses, or communicates to third persons while carrying on
its business. The legislation is being amended at the writing of
this document. Employers should consult with their lawyer as to
the current legislation and regulations.
http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/P-39.1

Voluntary Retirement Savings Plans
A VRSP is a retirement savings plan administered by a financial
institution in which employees are automatically enrolled.
Employees can opt out if they wish.

The policy could be set out as follows:
 •     We are an equal opportunity employer. This means that we do not permit direct or
       indirect discrimination against any employee on the grounds of race, nationality, sex,
       sexual orientation, disability, religion, marital status or age.
 •     Direct discrimination takes place when a person is treated less favourably than others
       are, or would be, treated in similar circumstances.
 •     Indirect discrimination takes place when, whether intentional or not, a condition is
       applied that adversely affects a considerable proportion of people of one race, national-
       ity, sex, sexual orientation, religion or marital status, or those with disabilities or older
       employees.
 •     The firm will ensure that equal opportunity principles are applied in all its HR policies
       and in particular to the procedures relating to the recruitment, training, development
       and promotion of its employees. 994     HR Policies, Procedures and Systems

  •    Where appropriate and where permissible under the relevant legislation and codes of
       practice, employees of under-represented groups will be given positive training and
       encouragement to achieve equal opportunity.

Grievances
The policy on grievances could state that employees have the right to raise their grievances
with their manager, to be accompanied by a representative if they so wish, and to appeal to a
higher level if they feel that their grievance has not been resolved satisfactorily. The policy
should be supported by a grievance procedure (see Chapter 61).

Health and safety
Health and safety policies cover how the organization intends to provide healthy and safe
places and systems of work (see Chapter 58).

New technology
A new technology policy statement could state that there will be consultation about the intro-
duction of new technology and the steps that would be taken by the organization to minimize
the risk of compulsory redundancy or adverse effects on other terms and conditions or working
arrangements.

Promotion
A promotion policy could state the organization’s intention to promote from within wherever
this is appropriate as a means of satisfying its requirements for high-quality staff. The policy
could, however, recognize that there will be occasions when the organization’s present and
future needs can only be met by recruitment from outside. The point could be made that a
vigorous organization needs infusions of fresh blood from time to time if it is not to stagnate.

The    choice    of  candidate      should     be   based    upon   the
competence of the applicant to perform the work of the advertised post. In making the
appointment, account shall be taken of the City’s equal rights programme and cultural
diversity policy. Fairness shall be maintained at the job interview, and the appointment
shall be made in a formal manner. New staff shall receive information on the municipal
system as applicable in each case.

- Equality

Municipal institutions and companies shall comply with the City of Reykjavík’s cultural
diversity policy and equality programme. It shall be ensured that no discrimination in
terms of employment is made between members of staff on grounds of gender, race,
political views or religious conviction, or for other subjective reasons. Managers must
promote the effective assimilation of foreign staff in the workplace, and arrange for
studies in Icelandic if necessary.

- Termination of employment

Dismissal must be based upon objective grounds. An employee has a right to receive a
written explanation of the reasons for the decision to dismiss him/her. In the case of
alleged dereliction of duty, the supervisor must issue a reprimand, first giving the
employee chance to express his/her views on the matter, unless the offence is so
serious as to warrant immediate dismissal.
The employee shall have the opportunity for an interview with a member of management
on termination of employment.
Employees shall retire not later than the end of the month in which they reach the age of
70 years.

                                                                                                             2 2.   Employees’ continous learning, professional skills and job
     development.

- Continous learning

The City of Reykjavík strives to ensure that employees have opportunities for continous
learning , both within their institutions and outside, in order to add to their knowledge and
professional skills, which will prove useful in their work. It is the shared responsibility of
the employee and management to maintain and add to professional knowledge and
other specialised knowledge required in the employee’s work.
Employees’ efforts in enhancing their skills in this manner contribute to their job security.

 - Personnel interviews

The City of Reykjavík wishes its employees’ talents to be able to flourish in their work.
Employees of municipal institutons and companies are entitled to a personnel interview
at least once a year.

The policy should emphasize that if a
complaint is received it will be thoroughly investigated.

Discipline
The disciplinary policy should state that employees have the right to know what is expected of
them and what could happen if they infringe the organization’s rules. It would also make the
point that, in handling disciplinary cases, the organization will treat employees in accordance
with the principles of natural justice. It should be supported by a disciplinary procedure (see
Chapter 61).

Diversity management
A policy on managing diversity recognizes that there are differences among employees and
that these differences, if properly managed, will enable work to be done more efficiently and
effectively. It does not focus exclusively on issues of discrimination but instead concentrates on
recognizing the differences between people. As Kandola and Fullerton (1994) express it, the
concept of managing diversity ‘is founded on the premise that harnessing these differences will
create a productive environment in which everyone will feel valued, where their talents are
fully utilized, and in which organizational goals are met’.
Managing diversity is a concept that recognizes the benefits to be gained from differences. It
differs from equal opportunity, which aims to legislate against discrimination, assumes that
people should be assimilated into the organization and, often, relies on affirmative action. This
point was emphasized by Mulholland et al (2005) as follows:

     The new diversity management thinking suggests that diversity management goes
     beyond the equal opportunities management considerations as described by the law,
     and promises to make a positive and strategic contribution to the successful operation
     of business. So diversity management is being hailed as a proactive, strategically rele-
     vant and results-focused approach and a welcome departure from the equal opportuni-
     ties approach, which has been defined as reactive, operational and sometimes
     counterproductive.

A management of diversity policy could: 992      HR Policies, Procedures and Systems

  •     acknowledge cultural and individual differences in the workplace;
  •     state that the organization values the different qualities that people bring to their jobs;
  •     emphasize the need to eliminate bias in such areas as selection, promotion, perform-
        ance assessment, pay and learning opportunities;
  •     focus attention on individual differences rather than group differences.

The principles of human resource policies, as outlined in the document, are:

1. **Respect for the individual**: Institutions and companies should respect their staff and their views.
2. **Collaboration and flexibility**: Encourage teamwork and adaptability in the workplace.
3. **Equality**: Promote fairness and equal rights among all employees.
4. **Knowledge and initiative**: Offer opportunities for staff to develop their knowledge and skills.
5. **Service mentality**: Prioritize a high standard of quality and service in all operations.

These principles guide how the City of Reykjavík manages its human resources, ensuring a competent and motivated workforce.","The term ""equality"" in the provided context refers to the right to non-discrimination, ensuring that individuals are treated fairly and without bias based on characteristics such as race, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, disability, religion, marital status, or age. It emphasizes the importance of equal opportunity in all human resource policies, including recruitment, training, development, and promotion.",HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_53 and 60 - HR Politicies.pdf_8 and human_resource_policies.pdf_2 and 60 - HR Politicies.pdf_5,2024-09-16 14:56:19
human_resources_documents,what is coordination between work and private life,"The City of Reykjavík stresses equality in interaction between
municipal employees. Rules on communications, chain of command and information
flow shall be clear, simple and accessible to all. The City of Reykjavík wishes to promote
a good work morale, and encourage employees to show their co-workers and others
appropriate respect, tolerance and a pleasant manner.

- Measures to be taken if rules of interaction are violated

A member of staff who verbally, by gesture or by other conduct threatens, disturbs or
provokes     others    in the   workplace,     bullies   another     employee      or  sexually    harasses
him/her, is deemed to have violated the essential rules of workplace interaction. Such
conduct may lead to a reprimand and dismissal.

- Workplace safety

Managers must seek to make the workplace environment healthy. Seeking to ensure the
well being and healthiness of staff serves the interests both of the city and of its
employees. Staff are responsible for taking care of their own health. The working
environment shall be free of harmful substances and other hazards, as far as possible.
Staff must also comply with requirements regarding safety and care in their work. In a
workplace where handling of hazardous substances is necessitated by the nature of the
work, it shall be ensured that the utmost safety is observed, and clear instructions shall
be given on the response to mishaps and accidents. It shall also be ensured that
overtime is within reasonable limits.

- Drug-free workplaces

The   City   of  Reykjavík     wishes     to  keep   its  workplaces      smoke-free.      Employees       are
prohibited from use of alcohol or other substances at work. The City of Reykjavík

                                                                                                             4 provides staff with guidance and assistance in dealing with problems relating to drug
abuse.

- Coordination of work and private life

The City of Reykjavík wishes to create conditions for its employees to coordinate the
demands of their professional and private lives as far as possible.                    The City of Reykjavík
wishes its employees to have flexibility at work wherever possible. Men and women shall
have the option of reducing their working hours temporarily due to family responsibilities.
Employees shall have the option of working part-time and flexible working hours, as far
as conditions will allow.

Work–life balance
Work–life balance policies define how the organization intends to allow employees greater
flexibility in their working patterns so that they can balance what they do at work with the
responsibilities and interests they have outside work. The policy will indicate how flexible
work practices can be developed and implemented. It will emphasize that the numbers of
hours worked must not be treated as a criterion for assessing performance. It will set out
guidelines on the specific arrangements that can be made, such as flexible hours, a compressed
working week, term-time working contracts, working at home, special leave for parents and
carers, career breaks and various kinds of child care.
A flexibility policy will need to take account of the Work and Families Act 2006, an extension
of which gives carers the right to request flexible working to care for an elderly or sick relative.
This provides for the following actions: 1) the request must be acknowledged in writing; 2) the
employee must be notified if not all the required information is provided, so that they can
resubmit the application properly completed; 3) if the employee unreasonably refuses to
provide the additional information needed, the employer can treat the application as with-
drawn; 4) a meeting has to be arranged with the employee within 28 days, to discuss the desired
work pattern and consider how it might be accommodated; 5) if the request cannot be accom-
modated, alternative working arrangements may be discussed and a trial period agreed. In
certain circumstances, a solution might be to develop an informal arrangement, outside the
legislation, to allow flexible working for a limited period.                                                                                                  HR Policies     997

Formulating HR policies
HR policies need to address the key HR issues that have been identified in the organization.
They must also take account of external influences such as legislation. The maximum amount
of consultation should take place with managers, employees and their representatives and the
policies should be communicated widely with guidelines on their application. The following
steps should be taken when formulating HR policies.

     Formulating HR policies
     1.   Gain understanding of the corporate culture and its shared values.
     2.   Analyse existing policies – written and unwritten. HR policies will exist in any
          organization, even if they are implicit rather than expressed formally.
     3.   Analyse external influences.

3.2.5.3.    Employees who fail to report for work three (3) consecutive days without notice or
                 prior approval will be deemed to have voluntarily terminated their appointment
                 through job abandonment. However, where an employee’s failure to report for work
                 is due to circumstances beyond the employee’s control, the employee’s appointment
                 may be considered for reinstatement.
     3.2.5.4.    Where an employee’s absence from work was due to arrest by the police or
                 conviction and imprisonment by the Civil Courts, the decision to terminate the
                 employee’s appointment will be based on the merits of the case. The days of absence
                 will be deducted from the employee’s annual leave days.
     3.2.5.5.    Employees are not expected to leave their duty posts during work hours without the
                 knowledge/approval of their supervisors.

3.2.6. Public Holidays
     3.2.6.1.    IHVN observes National public holidays as declared by the Federal Government of
                 Nigeria. The Institute shall notify all employees at least a day before the holiday.
     3.2.6.2.    However, some employees may be required to work during such holidays to avoid
                 interruptions to business operations.
     3.2.6.3.    Where public holidays fall within an employee’s approved annual leave period, such
                 days shall not be counted as part of the employee’s approved leave days.

3.3. Work Environment
3.3.1. Work Areas and Tidiness
     3.3.1.1.    Employees are expected to perform their work activities in the designated office
                 areas. Employees must keep their offices or work areas neat and tidy. Desks should
                 be well arranged and kept clean.
     3.3.1.2.    At the close of work, files, documents, stationery and work tools should be properly
                 stored before leaving the office. For the purpose of security, documents and materials
                 of sensitive nature should be properly filed/locked away at the close of work each
                 day.
     3.3.1.3.    Employees must show consideration and respect for their fellow employees in their
                 use of office space and work tools. Noise and distractions must be minimized and
                 office standards maintained.

•     Performance through people – the importance attached to developing a per-
             formance culture and to continuous improvement; the significance of perform-
             ance management as a means of defining and agreeing mutual expectations; the
             provision of fair feedback to people on how well they are performing.
       •     Quality of working life – consciously and continually aiming to improve the
             quality of working life. This involves increasing the sense of satisfaction people
             obtain from their work by, so far as possible, reducing monotony, increasing
             variety, autonomy and responsibility, avoiding placing people under too much
             stress and providing for an acceptable balance between work and life outside
             work.
       •     Working conditions – providing healthy, safe and, so far as practicable, pleasant
             working conditions.

These values are espoused by many organizations in one form or another. But to what extent
are they practised when making ‘business-led’ decisions which can, of course, be highly detri-
mental to employees if, for example, they lead to redundancy? One of the dilemmas facing all
those who formulate HR policies is: ‘How can we pursue business-led policies focusing on
business success and fulfil our obligations to employees in such terms as equity, consideration, 990     HR Policies, Procedures and Systems

quality of working life and working conditions?’ To argue, as some do, that HR strategies
should be entirely business-led seems to imply that human considerations are unimportant.
Organizations have obligations to all their stakeholders, not just their owners.
It may be difficult to express these policies in anything but generalized terms, but employers
are increasingly having to recognize that they are subject to external as well as internal pres-
sures that act as constraints on the extent to which they can disregard the higher standards of
behaviour towards their employees that are expected of them.

Specific HR policies
The most common areas in which specific HR policies exist are age and employment, AIDS,
bullying, discipline, e-mails and the internet, employee development, employee relations,
employee voice, employment, equal opportunity, grievances, health and safety, managing
diversity, promotion, redundancy, reward, sexual harassment, substance abuse and work–life
balance.

The term ""equality"" in the provided context refers to the right to non-discrimination, ensuring that individuals are treated fairly and without bias based on characteristics such as race, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, disability, religion, marital status, or age. It emphasizes the importance of equal opportunity in all human resource policies, including recruitment, training, development, and promotion.","The City of Reykjavík aims to create conditions that allow employees to coordinate the demands of their professional and private lives as much as possible. This includes providing flexibility at work, such as the option for employees to temporarily reduce their working hours due to family responsibilities, work part-time, and have flexible working hours when conditions allow. Additionally, work-life balance policies are in place to offer greater flexibility in working patterns, ensuring that the number of hours worked is not the sole criterion for assessing performance.

General Policies

Decent Work
Decent work means more than fair wages and benefits. It reflects a cultural shift that builds on the values that drive
your work in your community. Decent workplaces are fair, stable and productive workplaces. Decent work means
building a culture of equality and inclusion at work, and ensuring everyone’s voices are valued and heard. Decent
work means acknowledging the highly gendered nature of the nonprofit sector’s workforce – and developing
solutions that address women’s particular interests and concerns.

Through adopting decent work practices, your organization will be better able to meet your mission and contribute
to thriving communities. And in doing so, you help build a stronger, more resilient nonprofit sector.

The above text is used with permission of the Ontario Non-Profit Network. ONN also has an extensive Decent Work
Checklist that can help to guide your foundation in incorporating this concept throughout your organization.

Code of Ethics

     A code of ethics is important for organizations to establish and ensure that everyone in the
     organization is clear on the mission, values and guiding principles. The code provides employees,
     volunteers and contractors with a framework of which rules exist, from a regulatory and
     law-enforcement standpoint and how to act in the grey areas of values-based ethics that aren’t always
     clear. The policy below provides a framework from which with your foundation can base your policy.
     Amend to align with your foundation’s practices.

PREAMBLE:
As a matter of fundamental principle, the Foundation requires the highest ethical standards because public trust in
our performance is the bedrock of our legitimacy. Donors, volunteers and grant recipients trust the Foundation to
carry out its mission, to be good stewards of endowment funds, and to uphold rigorous standards of conduct.

The Foundation must earn this trust every day. It is therefore essential the people involved with the Foundation,
board members, employees and volunteers demonstrate their ongoing commitment to the core values of integrity,
honesty, impartiality, openness, respect, and responsibility.

Simple adherence to the law is not enough. The Foundation will often need to go beyond legal requirements and
make sure that its actions are transparent, open and responsive to public concerns.

human_resources_documents,what is harassment free workplace,"The supervisor is to confirm the employee,
volunteer or contractor has taken steps to resolve per the following procedure.

Harassment and Discrimination Prevention
The Foundation is committed to providing every employee, volunteer or contractor with a workplace free from
harassment and discrimination, whether prohibited by human rights legislation or otherwise. The Foundation will
not tolerate incidents of harassment or discrimination brought to its attention and will act swiftly to investigate and
resolve all such manners.

The Foundation recognizes that employees, volunteers and contractors may also be subject to harassment and
discrimination from others who conduct business with the Foundation. In these circumstances, because this policy
is intended to apply in all cases of harassment and discrimination, the Foundation will assist and support the person
affected by the harassment or discrimination.

The Foundation also recognizes that prohibited harassment and discrimination can occur at places other than the
physical workplace. Employees, volunteers and contractors have the right to be free from harassment and
discrimination in all locations where work is conducted on behalf of the Foundation, or where the individual is
present at the location only by virtue of their work with the Foundation.

Definitions:
Discrimination: Means any action, inaction or behaviour which negatively affects the status of an employee or
anyone with whom he/she comes into contact at the Foundation. It is also the treatment of anyone unequally, on
the basis of any prohibited ground under human rights legislation, such as sex, race, colour, creed, religion, national
or ethnic origin, age, disability, family or marital status or sexual orientation.

Workplace: The workplace is not solely the office in which business of the Foundation is conducted. Any improper
conduct occurring outside of the office but having repercussions in the work environment and adversely affecting
employment, volunteer or contractor relationships may also be defined as workplace harassment.

Verbal Harassment: Foul or obscene language, derogatory racial comments, demeaning ethnic jokes or slurs,
unwanted sexual comments, implied or expressed promises of reward for complying with, or threats or reprisal for
not complying with, a sexually oriented request.

Physical & Sexual Harassment: These include practical jokes, pushing, shoving, aggressive behavior and the like.
Acts of sexual harassment include any unwanted physical contact, unnecessary touching, or physical interference
with work or movement.

Employers are
     obligated to take appropriate action against any employee, volunteer or contractor who harasses
     someone. Otherwise, an employer can be held responsible for harassment committed by them.
     Adopting a harassment policy can foster an environment of respect for human rights and helps people
     in the organization understand their rights and responsibilities. Policies can protect an organization
     from discrimination complaints. The policy below, created by an Alberta-based foundation, is a
     template upon which your Foundation can base your policy. The Canadian Human Rights Commission
     also has anti-harassment policy templates, which can be found at www.chrc-ccdp.gc.ca/en. Appendix
     A includes links to provincial human rights legislation and regulations.

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation will ensure every employee, volunteer and contractor fair and equal treatment and consideration.
According to the Alberta Human Rights Code, harassment is engaging in an abusive or vexatious course of
comment or conduct that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome. It is a form of discrimination
and can include behaviour such as demands, threats, gestures, innuendo, unwelcome remarks, jokes, slurs, display
of offensive material, physical or sexual assault or taunting about a person’s body, clothing, habits, customs or
mannerisms. Harassment can also include inappropriate or unwelcome comments regarding a person’s physical
characteristics and/or mental health.

                                                                                                        Policies and Procedures Template - Page 38 The Foundation has a legal obligation to ensure the safety and well-being of all employees, volunteers and
contractors therefore, depending on the nature and gravity of an incident, the Foundation reserves the right to
conduct an investigation regardless of whether or not a formal complaint has been filed.

It is the responsibility of any employee, volunteer or contractor experiencing or aware of any type of harassment
within the Foundation to report the situation to their supervisor. The supervisor is to confirm the employee,
volunteer or contractor has taken steps to resolve per the following procedure.

Harassment and Discrimination Prevention
The Foundation is committed to providing every employee, volunteer or contractor with a workplace free from

Physical & Sexual Harassment: These include practical jokes, pushing, shoving, aggressive behavior and the like.
Acts of sexual harassment include any unwanted physical contact, unnecessary touching, or physical interference
with work or movement.

Visual Harassment: These include obscene gestures, demeaning posters, cartoons, graffiti or drawings which are
shown to an individual or group or displayed in plain view. Where these have a sexual orientation, this will
constitute sexual harassment.

                                                                                                          Policies and Procedures Template - Page 39 Procedure:
Where, in the opinion of the employee, volunteer or contractor unfair treatment has been rendered or a problem
arises, the following procedure shall be followed.

           1.    If possible, immediately tell the person whom you feel is harassing you that their conduct or behaviour
                 is unwelcome and that you wish it to be stopped.

           2.    Make some notes about what happened (what was said or done), when it happened (date, time and
                 place), who was involved and who may have witnessed the incident. You will want these details to
                 refresh your memory and in case the problem is not corrected and you have to take the matter further.

           3.    If the harassing behaviour continues, or if you feel unable to approach the harasser directly about this
                 problem, report the incident to the appropriate supervisor within seven (7) days of the incident. If the
                 supervisor is the cause of the problem the situation should be discussed with the ED/CEO. If the
                 ED/CEO is the cause of the problem the situation should be discussed with the Board Chair. The
                 employee, volunteer or contractor has the choice of either discussing the problem (in the case of an
                 informal concern) or submitting a formal or written concern.

           4.    In cases where the concern can be corrected in an informal manner, the supervisor (or Chair of the
                 Board) may discuss the situation with everyone involved, develop an action plan, and check with the
                 employee periodically to ensure the problem is being resolved.

           5.    In cases where the concern has been put in writing a full investigation will be carried out, every effort
                 will be made to resolve the problem to the employee’s satisfaction.

           6.    If the supervisor has been unable to resolve the situation within (10) working days, the supervisor shall
                 take the matter to the ED/CEO.

Contact numbers provided should be verified by
                 dialling them back subsequently. Where a mobile number is provided as the person’s
                 contact number, employees shall request for an alternative fixed line number.
     7.4.8.4.    When visiting or going out for meetings, employees shall notify their colleagues and
                 provide information such as the name of the contact person, venue address and
                 meeting duration and expected return time. If the meeting will last longer that the
                 planned duration, employees should notify their colleagues. Employees must always
                 complete the Staff Movement Register in their departments or units.

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation is committed to providing a work environment that is free of harassment and supportive of the
dignity, self-esteem and productivity of every employee. The Foundation will not tolerate any form of harassment of,
or by, employees, stakeholders, volunteers, students, contractors, suppliers or other individuals associated with the
Foundation while engaged in activities pertaining to the workplace. The Foundation has developed a more
comprehensive policy addressing the details surrounding this issue. Please refer to the Anti-Harassment Policy
further on in this document.

                                                                                                           Policies and Procedures Template - Page 7 Confidentiality

     Confidentiality in the workplace is of primary importance to business etiquette. Not only are you
     showing your stakeholders a level of common courtesy by protecting their data, but you are also
     fulfilling your legal responsibility to prevent sensitive information from being used inappropriately or
     being leaked.

     Foundations can replace their own confidentiality policy and procedures with the text below. If using
     this text, Foundations should ask the following question for each of the statements and amend
     accordingly if the statement does not align: “Does this statement align with our Foundation’s values
     and principles?”

Policy and Procedure Statement
           1.   General

                Employees, volunteers, and contractors of the Foundation will treat information provided or gathered
                by the Foundation with discretion. Any information received through involvement with the Foundation
                will not be used for personal gain.

           2.   Donors

                Donor requests for confidentiality and anonymity will be strictly respected. Access to donor information
                will be restricted to only those who need it for the function of their duties. Paper records will be kept
                locked and computer records are protected using password protocols. Donor lists will not be shared
                with any other fundraising organizations.

           3.   Grant Recipients

                The Foundation grant making process requires charities and agencies to provide detailed project and
                organizational information. This information will often be of a sensitive nature, and will therefore be
                treated in confidence by employees.

                 agreement and the second copy will be filed and a scanned copy is saved on the server.

Conflict of Interest

      When a conflict of interest occurs, it can erode public and internal trust, damage the Foundation’s
      reputation, potentially hurt the organization financially and, in some cases, break the law. While one
      may think conflict of interest applies only to people serving on the Foundation’s board, it really can
      occur at any level within an organization, including part-time employees and contractors.

      Foundations can replace their own Conflict of Interest policy and procedures with the text below.
      Foundations should check with legal counsel to ensure their text is enforceable in their province.

Policy and Procedure Statement
A Foundation must strive, as far as possible, to conduct its affairs in an honest, forthright, and impartial manner. It is
not enough that those making decisions believe that they are operating from the highest motives, and that any
particular action is innocent. So far as possible, actions and relationships must avoid any appearance of impropriety
that may raise questions in the minds of the public.

The Foundation recognizes that employees will be associated with organizations that, from time to time, may apply
for funding.

A harassment-free workplace is one where every employee, volunteer, or contractor is provided an environment free from harassment and discrimination. This includes any behavior that is unwanted, unwelcome, or uninvited, which demeans, threatens, or offends individuals, creating a hostile environment. The Foundation is committed to swiftly investigating and resolving any incidents of harassment or discrimination, ensuring that all individuals are treated with dignity, courtesy, and respect. This commitment extends to all locations where work is conducted on behalf of the Foundation, not just the physical office.","Confidentiality in the workplace is of primary importance to business etiquette. It involves treating information provided or gathered by the Foundation with discretion and ensuring that sensitive information is not used inappropriately or leaked. Employees, volunteers, and contractors are expected to respect donor requests for confidentiality, keep sensitive information about grant recipients confidential, and maintain the confidentiality of contracts and meetings.

General Policies

Decent Work
Decent work means more than fair wages and benefits. It reflects a cultural shift that builds on the values that drive
your work in your community. Decent workplaces are fair, stable and productive workplaces. Decent work means
building a culture of equality and inclusion at work, and ensuring everyone’s voices are valued and heard. Decent
work means acknowledging the highly gendered nature of the nonprofit sector’s workforce – and developing
solutions that address women’s particular interests and concerns.

Through adopting decent work practices, your organization will be better able to meet your mission and contribute
to thriving communities. And in doing so, you help build a stronger, more resilient nonprofit sector.

The above text is used with permission of the Ontario Non-Profit Network. ONN also has an extensive Decent Work
Checklist that can help to guide your foundation in incorporating this concept throughout your organization.

Code of Ethics

     A code of ethics is important for organizations to establish and ensure that everyone in the
     organization is clear on the mission, values and guiding principles. The code provides employees,
     volunteers and contractors with a framework of which rules exist, from a regulatory and
     law-enforcement standpoint and how to act in the grey areas of values-based ethics that aren’t always
     clear. The policy below provides a framework from which with your foundation can base your policy.
     Amend to align with your foundation’s practices.

PREAMBLE:
As a matter of fundamental principle, the Foundation requires the highest ethical standards because public trust in
our performance is the bedrock of our legitimacy. Donors, volunteers and grant recipients trust the Foundation to
carry out its mission, to be good stewards of endowment funds, and to uphold rigorous standards of conduct.

The Foundation must earn this trust every day. It is therefore essential the people involved with the Foundation,
board members, employees and volunteers demonstrate their ongoing commitment to the core values of integrity,
honesty, impartiality, openness, respect, and responsibility.

Simple adherence to the law is not enough. The Foundation will often need to go beyond legal requirements and
make sure that its actions are transparent, open and responsive to public concerns.

The Board of Directors promotes the highest standards of ethical behaviour. The Code of Ethics which relates
specifically to Foundation employees includes:

           1.   Integrity: Foundation members shall act with competence, honesty, integrity, respect and fairness
                while carrying out their obligations for the Foundation.

           2.   Role: The wellbeing of the people of our community will be the primary role of Foundation members. In
                addition, employees, volunteers and contractors will act in the best interests of the Foundation in
                fulfilling its mission.

           3.   Accountability and Transparency: In carrying out philanthropic activities employees, volunteers and
                contractors will act within the letter and the spirit of the law. The Foundation embraces public interest,
                takes full responsibility for its actions, communicates truthfully, and ensures public records are easily
                available while maintaining appropriate privacy and confidentiality. The Foundation will manage its
                resources carefully and frugally, actively avoiding excessive expense.

           4.   Diversity and Inclusiveness: The Foundation will seek diversity and inclusiveness in order to reflect
                our community. The Foundation will strive to ensure that a full range of perspectives contribute to the
                common good of our organization. In conducting its business, all members of the Foundation will listen
                to and treat all others who come together under the auspices of the Foundation with respect.

Harassment-free Workplace

     Harassed employees, volunteers and contractors can develop anxiety, panic attacks and avoidance
     behaviours that decrease their effectiveness. They can lose motivation and experience a decline in
     their health and decision-making ability. Harassment can also result in legal costs and can damage the
     Foundation’s reputation.

The Foundation is committed to providing a work environment that is free of harassment and supportive of the
dignity, self-esteem and productivity of every employee.

                 may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. A conflict
                 of interest may also exist if a family member’s interest interferes with a person’s
                 independent exercise of sound judgment.
     3.6.4.      Employees should not have any financial or other business relationships with
                 suppliers, customers, contractors, competitors or other third parties with which the

                 independence of any judgment they may need to make on behalf of IHVN. In
                 addition, actions of family members may create a conflict of interest. For example,
                 doing business with an organisation that is partially or fully owned by members of
                 your family may create a conflict of interest.

In
                 addition, actions of family members may create a conflict of interest. For example,
                 doing business with an organisation that is partially or fully owned by members of
                 your family may create a conflict of interest.
     3.6.5.      Unless a written waiver is granted (as explained below), employees, are prohibited
                 from:
                       a. Performing services or having more than 5% financial interest in a private or
                            public company that is a supplier, customer, contractor or competitor of
                            IHVN;
                       b. Performing outside work or engaging in any external activity or enterprise
                            that may conflict with the Institute’s best interests;
                       c. Taking for themselves personally, opportunities that are discovered through
                            the use of the Institute’s property, information and position;

     3.6.7.      Employees are under a continuing obligation to disclose to their supervisors any
                 situation that presents the possibility of a conflict or disparity of interest between the
                 employee and the Institute.

                                                                                                             34 | P a g e      3.6.8.      An employee’s conflict of interest may only be waived by the CEO in writing. Copies of
                 any waivers or approvals given will be kept in the affected employee’s file and other
                 Institute records.
     3.6.9.      Violation of this policy shall attract the appropriate disciplinary sanction up to
                 summary dismissal.
     3.6.10.     All employees must sign the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form annually.

3.7.      Behaviour and General Conduct
3.7.1.    Relationship with Co-Workers
     3.7.1.1.     Employees are expected to maintain cordial official relationships with each other.
                  Close personal relationships can compromise objectivity in such matters as
                  performance evaluations, promotions and work assignments. They can also create
                  difficulties in maintaining a professional work climate and discipline generally.
     3.7.1.2.     Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against anyone whose poor exercise of
                  judgment in personal relationship interferes with the Institute’s operations.

3.7.2.

It is
not enough that those making decisions believe that they are operating from the highest motives, and that any
particular action is innocent. So far as possible, actions and relationships must avoid any appearance of impropriety
that may raise questions in the minds of the public.

The Foundation recognizes that employees will be associated with organizations that, from time to time, may apply
for funding. This policy is directed towards the sources of most potential conflict which include conflicts arising as a
result of affiliation with:

           ●     an organization or individual which has, or is negotiating, a business relationship with Foundation,

           ●     an organization seeking funding or other support from the Foundation.

Definitions:
Conflict of interest (as it applies to an “Individual”) means an actual, apparent or potential conflict of interest in the
exercise of unbiased judgment on behalf of the Foundation and its dealings with any person, who may be obligated
to the Foundation or may benefit from dealings with the Foundation.

For the purpose of this definition:

“Individual” means any officer, director, employee, contractor or volunteer who is working for or on behalf of the
Foundation and includes members of the Individual’s immediate family including, without limitation, the individual’s
common law spouse. “Person” means an individual person, corporation or body corporate, partnership,
organization, or any other recognizable group or association that purports to deal with the Foundation.

                                                                                                             Policies and Procedures Template - Page 9 Procedure:
A conflict of interest on the part of an employee, volunteer or contractor of the Foundation will be disclosed. When
any such interest becomes a matter of Board or Committee action, such individuals shall declare the conflict and
absent themselves from the discussion. The minutes of all actions taken related to the matter will clearly reflect that
these requirements have been met.

Reporting Violations
Policy and Procedure Statement
It is each employee’s, volunteer’s and contractor’s personal responsibility to bring violations or suspected violations
of the Foundation’s Code of Ethics to the attention of the ED/CEO. The Foundation’s policy prohibits any retribution
against employees, volunteers or contractors who come forward to make such reports. Whenever practical, all
reports or allegations will be thoroughly investigated by the ED/CEO prior to judgments being made or action being
taken in response to suspected violations.

A code of ethics is essential for organizations to clarify their mission, values, and guiding principles. It provides a framework for employees, volunteers, and contractors regarding rules and ethical conduct, especially in ambiguous situations. The key components of a code of ethics include:

1. **Integrity**: Members must act with competence, honesty, integrity, respect, and fairness.
2. **Role**: The wellbeing of the community is prioritized, and members should act in the Foundation's best interests.
3. **Accountability and Transparency**: Members must adhere to the law, embrace public interest, and manage resources responsibly.
4. **Diversity and Inclusiveness**: The Foundation seeks to reflect community diversity and treat all individuals with respect.

Additionally, the document outlines specific ethical standards, such as maintaining integrity, avoiding conflicts of interest, and ensuring confidentiality in the workplace.","A conflict of interest arises when an employee is involved in situations or activities that may benefit them personally due to their position, or at the expense of the Institute. It can occur when an employee's actions or interests make it difficult to perform their work objectively and effectively. Additionally, conflicts may arise from the interests of family members that interfere with an employee's independent judgment. Employees are expected to avoid any actions that may involve, or appear to involve, a conflict of interest with the Institute.",IHVN-HR-Policy-Manual-Final-PCL.pdf_36 and IHVN-HR-Policy-Manual-Final-PCL.pdf_37 and HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_8,2024-09-16 15:03:50
human_resources_documents,policy and procedure statement,"Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation values professional development for its employees and will budget annually for such opportunities.

From time to time employees will be requested to take up-grading courses or other courses related to their
position. The Foundation shall pay flights and accommodations (if required), as well as tuition costs for these
courses. The Foundation shall pay for a regular day of work only, travel time is not paid. Employees will be
responsible for all meals and incidentals. All courses must have prior written approval from the ED/CEO.

Leave of Absence

     Leave of absence policies are meant to provide employees with work-life balance and, in certain
     circumstances, to give employees needed time away from work in urgent and compelling
     circumstances. Your provinces’ Employment Standards Act prescribes specific instances when leave
     must be granted. Appendix A provides links to provincial ESAs.

Policy and Procedure Statement
It is the policy of the Foundation to comply with the Employment Standards Code, and the Foundation reserves the
right to change its policy without notice if there is a change in such law. Due to the complexities of family and
medical leaves, it is important to contact the ED/CEO regarding specific leave requirement requests.

Requests for leave are accepted for the following periods of unpaid leave:

Emergency Leave: An employee may receive up to ten days of leave to attend to family emergencies. This leave
will be unpaid, but will not affect seniority, benefits or the employee’s position. This leave will comply with the
Employment Standards Act. The ten days do not have to be taken consecutively. The employee must inform their
employer as soon as possible if they will need to take any of these days off. The employer has the right to ask for
proof of the emergency.

Personal Leave: A personal leave may be granted on a limited basis depending on business needs. This leave will
be unpaid. This leave complies with the Employment Standards Code. If an intermittent or reduced leave is

                                                                                                        Policies and Procedures Template - Page 23 requested on this basis, the Foundation may require the employee to temporarily transfer to an alternative position
with equivalent pay and benefits which better accommodate the intermittent or leave schedule.

Medical/Disability Leave: An employee may be granted a medical leave because of a serious health condition or
non-work-related injury due to an accident. This leave complies with the Employment Standards Code.

Policy and Procedure Statement
Employees are requested to provide written notice to their immediate supervisor of their intended resignation.

Employees giving notice or receiving notice of termination will receive a record of employment, together with all
wages outstanding, including any vacation pay accrued.

All cases of employer termination shall comply with provincial/federal employment standards legislation.

Issuing References

     No opinions on an employee’s competency or qualifications should come through a reference. Only
     standard issue HR information should be in the reference. True, the difficult burden of proving a former
     employee didn’t get a new job because of your reference lies with the employee, but a disgruntled
     employee could still make you litigate or alternatively the new employer could sue if the old manager
     didn’t mention something important. Having a neutral policy that applies to everyone means that your
     Board and lawyer sleep better at night.

Policy and Procedure Statement
It is the policy of the Foundation to respect the confidentiality of employee records and therefore discretion and
sensitivity are used when issuing references and employee verification.

Procedure:
Letters of reference will be issued at the request of the employee and will include employee name, title, dates of
employment, a brief overview of key tasks and accomplishments, and rate of pay (if requested by employee).

                                                                                                      Policies and Procedures Template - Page 41                APPENDIX A

               Legislation affecting relationship between employers
               and employees in Canada’s provinces and territories

ALBERTA
Employment Standards Code and Regulations
The Employment Standards Code establishes Alberta’s
minimum standards of employment in many areas
including payment of wages, hours of work, overtime,
vacation, and holidays, leaves and termination of
employment. It establishes the processes by which an
employee can seek recourse if the standards have not
been met.
https://www.alberta.ca/alberta-employment-standards-rules.aspx

Alberta Human Rights Act
The Alberta Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination in
employment based on the grounds of race, colour,
ancestry, place of origin, religious beliefs, gender, gender
identity, gender expression, age, physical disability,
mental disability, marital status, family status, source of
income and sexual orientation. Employers are expected
to create an inclusive workplace that respects the dignity
of every individual. Employees can also play an important
role in creating an inclusive workplace by understanding
their rights and responsibilities under the AHR Act.

Policy and Procedure Statement
Maintaining a professional, business-like appearance is very important to the success of the Foundation.

Regardless of the employee’s interaction with clients, customers, suppliers, contractors, or volunteers, each
employee projects the reputation of the organization. Part of this impression depends on each employee’s choice
of attire.

The Foundation has chosen to offer a casual dress environment for employees. Employees are expected to use
good judgment and to show courtesy to their co-workers by dressing in a manner that is presentable and
appropriate. At all times employees are asked to be cognizant that regardless of their interaction with clients,
customers, suppliers, contractors, or volunteers, the Foundation is still a place of business.

Should employees be asked to attend business meetings with clients, either in the Foundation offices or otherwise,
they should dress in appropriate business attire.

Overtime/Lieu Time
     This section needs to align with your provincial employment standards. The policy suggested is an
     approach that you can take but you may want to handle hours worked beyond the standard work week
     in a different way than the below policy suggests.

Policy and Procedure Statement
Overtime is considered to be anything over 8 hours worked in a day and excess of 44 hours in a week for full-time
employees.

The Foundation will grant time off for hours worked beyond what would be considered a standard work week. Any
hours worked in excess of 8 hours per day or 44 hours in a week will be banked at 1.5 times of the employee’s
actual hours worked. The time off will be taken at a time mutually agreeable to the ED/CEO and the employee(s). If
the accumulated time is not taken within six months, the employer will pay the overtime hours at the prescribed
rate of 1.5 times the employee’s regular wage.

The maximum time that an employee may claim is 12 hours per day of work time for out of town trips or
conferences.

Employees must be properly authorized to work overtime in advance as a condition for being credited for such
overtime, except in emergency situations where prior consent cannot be obtained. In such cases, the employee will
advise the ED/CEO of circumstances as soon as possible.

Employees shall be required to submit a completed “Overtime Approval Form” to the ED/CEO for approval.

They can lose motivation and experience a decline in
     their health and decision-making ability. Harassment can also result in legal costs and can damage the
     Foundation’s reputation.

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation is committed to providing a work environment that is free of harassment and supportive of the
dignity, self-esteem and productivity of every employee. The Foundation will not tolerate any form of harassment of,
or by, employees, stakeholders, volunteers, students, contractors, suppliers or other individuals associated with the
Foundation while engaged in activities pertaining to the workplace. The Foundation has developed a more
comprehensive policy addressing the details surrounding this issue. Please refer to the Anti-Harassment Policy
further on in this document.

                                                                                                           Policies and Procedures Template - Page 7 Confidentiality

     Confidentiality in the workplace is of primary importance to business etiquette. Not only are you
     showing your stakeholders a level of common courtesy by protecting their data, but you are also
     fulfilling your legal responsibility to prevent sensitive information from being used inappropriately or
     being leaked.

     Foundations can replace their own confidentiality policy and procedures with the text below. If using
     this text, Foundations should ask the following question for each of the statements and amend
     accordingly if the statement does not align: “Does this statement align with our Foundation’s values
     and principles?”

Policy and Procedure Statement
           1.   General

                Employees, volunteers, and contractors of the Foundation will treat information provided or gathered
                by the Foundation with discretion. Any information received through involvement with the Foundation
                will not be used for personal gain.

           2.   Donors

                Donor requests for confidentiality and anonymity will be strictly respected. Access to donor information
                will be restricted to only those who need it for the function of their duties. Paper records will be kept
                locked and computer records are protected using password protocols. Donor lists will not be shared
                with any other fundraising organizations.

           3.   Grant Recipients

                The Foundation grant making process requires charities and agencies to provide detailed project and
                organizational information. This information will often be of a sensitive nature, and will therefore be
                treated in confidence by employees.

           4.   Contracts/Grants

                The Foundation as a necessity will contract with professional and business corporations and details of
                all such transactions will be treated with respect and discretion.

A conflict of interest arises when an employee is involved in situations or activities that may benefit them personally due to their position, or at the expense of the Institute. It can occur when an employee's actions or interests make it difficult to perform their work objectively and effectively. Additionally, conflicts may arise from the interests of family members that interfere with an employee's independent judgment. Employees are expected to avoid any actions that may involve, or appear to involve, a conflict of interest with the Institute.","The document contains several policy and procedure statements related to employee development, leave of absence, resignation, references, confidentiality, and conflict of interest. 

1. **Professional Development**: The Foundation budgets annually for employee development, covering costs for courses with prior written approval from the ED/CEO.

2. **Leave of Absence**: Policies provide for emergency leave, personal leave, and medical/disability leave, all complying with the Employment Standards Code.

3. **Resignation and Termination**: Employees must provide written notice of resignation, and upon termination, they will receive a record of employment and outstanding wages.

4. **References**: References will include basic employment information without opinions on competency.

Specific HR policies
The most common areas in which specific HR policies exist are age and employment, AIDS,
bullying, discipline, e-mails and the internet, employee development, employee relations,
employee voice, employment, equal opportunity, grievances, health and safety, managing
diversity, promotion, redundancy, reward, sexual harassment, substance abuse and work–life
balance.

Age and employment
The policy on age and employment should take into account the UK legislation on age dis-
crimination and the following facts:
  •    age is a poor predictor of job performance;
  •    it is misleading to equate physical and mental ability with age;
  •    more of the population are living active, healthy lives as they get older.

AIDS
An AIDS policy could include the following points:
  •    The risk through infection in the workplace is negligible.
  •    Where the occupation does involve blood contact, as in hospitals, doctors’ surgeries
       and laboratories, the special precautions advised by the Health and Safety Commission
       will be implemented.
  •    Employees who know that they are infected with HIV will not be obliged to disclose the
       fact to the company, but if they do, the fact will remain completely confidential.
  •    There will be no discrimination against anyone with or at risk of acquiring AIDS.
  •    Employees infected by HIV or suffering from AIDS will be treated no differently from
       anyone else suffering a severe illness.                                                                                                     HR Policies  991

Bullying
An anti-bullying policy will state that bullying will not be tolerated by the organization and
that those who persist in bullying their staff will be subject to disciplinary action, which could
be severe in particularly bad cases. The policy will make it clear that individuals who are being
bullied should have the right to discuss the problem with another person; a representative or a
member of the HR function, and to make a complaint. The policy should emphasize that if a
complaint is received it will be thoroughly investigated.

Discipline
The disciplinary policy should state that employees have the right to know what is expected of
them and what could happen if they infringe the organization’s rules. It would also make the
point that, in handling disciplinary cases, the organization will treat employees in accordance
with the principles of natural justice. It should be supported by a disciplinary procedure (see
Chapter 61).

The document contains several policy and procedure statements related to employee development, leave of absence, resignation, references, confidentiality, and conflict of interest. 

1. **Professional Development**: The Foundation budgets annually for employee development, covering costs for courses with prior written approval from the ED/CEO.

1.   Staff Employment Rights

- Vacancies

Municipal     institutions   and   companies       shall   advertise    vacancies      in  accord   with  the
principal rules of the City of Reykjavík. The principle of fairness shall be maintained
during    the   hiring   process.     The    choice    of  candidate      should     be   based    upon   the
competence of the applicant to perform the work of the advertised post. In making the
appointment, account shall be taken of the City’s equal rights programme and cultural
diversity policy. Fairness shall be maintained at the job interview, and the appointment
shall be made in a formal manner. New staff shall receive information on the municipal
system as applicable in each case.

•     Performance through people – the importance attached to developing a per-
             formance culture and to continuous improvement; the significance of perform-
             ance management as a means of defining and agreeing mutual expectations; the
             provision of fair feedback to people on how well they are performing.
       •     Quality of working life – consciously and continually aiming to improve the
             quality of working life. This involves increasing the sense of satisfaction people
             obtain from their work by, so far as possible, reducing monotony, increasing
             variety, autonomy and responsibility, avoiding placing people under too much
             stress and providing for an acceptable balance between work and life outside
             work.
       •     Working conditions – providing healthy, safe and, so far as practicable, pleasant
             working conditions.

These values are espoused by many organizations in one form or another. But to what extent
are they practised when making ‘business-led’ decisions which can, of course, be highly detri-
mental to employees if, for example, they lead to redundancy? One of the dilemmas facing all
those who formulate HR policies is: ‘How can we pursue business-led policies focusing on
business success and fulfil our obligations to employees in such terms as equity, consideration, 990     HR Policies, Procedures and Systems

quality of working life and working conditions?’ To argue, as some do, that HR strategies
should be entirely business-led seems to imply that human considerations are unimportant.
Organizations have obligations to all their stakeholders, not just their owners.
It may be difficult to express these policies in anything but generalized terms, but employers
are increasingly having to recognize that they are subject to external as well as internal pres-
sures that act as constraints on the extent to which they can disregard the higher standards of
behaviour towards their employees that are expected of them.

Specific HR policies
The most common areas in which specific HR policies exist are age and employment, AIDS,
bullying, discipline, e-mails and the internet, employee development, employee relations,
employee voice, employment, equal opportunity, grievances, health and safety, managing
diversity, promotion, redundancy, reward, sexual harassment, substance abuse and work–life
balance.

Introduction
HR policies are continuing guidelines on how people should be managed in the organization.
They define the philosophies and values of the organization on how people should be treated,
and from these are derived the principles upon which managers are expected to act when
dealing with HR matters. HR policies should be distinguished from procedures, as discussed
in Chapter 61. A policy provides generalized guidance on how HR issues should be dealt with;
a procedure spells out precisely what steps should be taken to deal with major employment
issues such as grievances, discipline, capability and redundancy.

Why have HR policies?
HR policies provide guidelines on how key aspects of people management should be handled.
The aim is to ensure that any HR issues are dealt with consistently in accordance with the
values of the organization in line with certain defined principles. All organizations have HR
policies. Some, however, exist implicitly as a philosophy of management and an attitude to
employees that is expressed in the way in which HR issues are handled; for example, the intro-
duction of new technology. The advantage of explicit policies in terms of consistency and
understanding may appear to be obvious, but there are disadvantages: written policies can be
inflexible, constrictive, platitudinous, or all three. To a degree, policies have often to be
expressed in abstract terms and managers do not care for abstractions. But they do want to
know where they stand – people like structure – and formalized HR policies can provide the
guidelines they need.
Formalized HR policies can be used in induction, team leader and management training to
help participants understand the philosophies and values of the organization and how they are
expected to behave within that context. They are a means for defining the employment rela-
tionship and the psychological contract.
HR policies can be expressed formally as overall statements of the values of the organization
or in specific areas, as discussed in this chapter.

Overall HR policy
The overall HR policy defines how the organization fulfils its social responsibilities to its
employees and sets out its attitudes towards them.

The eligibility and scope of the policy on terrorism/debarment apply to all full-time employees of the Institute, as stated in the Employee Conditions of Service and Handbook. Full-time employees are those who work 100% work effort and are eligible for the institute’s benefits while adhering to the stated hours of normal work. Additionally, the policy also applies to contractors, suppliers, consultants, and all third parties engaged by IHVN in its day-to-day activities and programs.","The principles of human resource philosophy outlined in the provided content include:

1. **Our People Are Our Investment**: Viewing staff as valuable assets and committing to their long-term growth and development.
   
2. **Performance Matters**: Ensuring fair and equitable treatment based on performance-oriented assessments that consider competence, commitment, and flexibility.

3. **Diversity and Respect**: Valuing and respecting every individual, celebrating diversity within the framework of ethics and performance expectations.

4. **Respect for the Individual**: Acknowledging the importance of each employee's views and contributions.

5. **Collaboration and Flexibility**: Encouraging teamwork and adaptability in the workplace.

6. **Equality**: Promoting fairness and equal rights among all employees.

7. **Knowledge and Initiative**: Supporting employees in developing their knowledge and taking initiative in their roles.

8. **Service Mentality**: Fostering a culture focused on providing excellent service.

The consolidated manpower plan, organogram and budget is submitted to the Vice Chancellor for
approval. The approved manpower budget forms the basis for recruitment of manpower during the
year. Any recruitment over and above the approved budget of manpower requires prior approval of
the Vice Chancellor.

Promotion
A promotion policy could state the organization’s intention to promote from within wherever
this is appropriate as a means of satisfying its requirements for high-quality staff. The policy
could, however, recognize that there will be occasions when the organization’s present and
future needs can only be met by recruitment from outside. The point could be made that a
vigorous organization needs infusions of fresh blood from time to time if it is not to stagnate.
In addition, the policy might state that employees will be encouraged to apply for internally
advertised jobs and will not be held back from promotion by their managers, however reluc-
tant the latter may be to lose them. The policy should define the approach the organization
adopts to engaging, promoting and training and older employees. It should emphasize that the
only criterion for selection or promotion should be ability to do the job, and for training, the
belief, irrespective of age, that the employee will benefit.

Redundancy
The redundancy policy should state that the aim of the organization is to provide for employ-
ment security. It is the organization’s intention to use its best endeavours to avoid involuntary                                                                                                   HR Policies  995

redundancy through its redeployment and retraining programmes. However, if redundancy is
unavoidable, those affected will be given fair and equitable treatment, the maximum amount
of warning, and every help that can be provided to obtain suitable alternative employment.
The policy should be supported by a redundancy procedure (see Chapter 61).

Reward
The reward policy could cover such matters as:
  •     providing an equitable pay system;
  •     equal pay for work of equal value;
  •     paying for performance, competence, skill or contribution;
  •     sharing in the success of the organization (gainsharing or profit sharing);
  •     the relationship between levels of pay in the organization and market rates;
  •     the provision of employee benefits, including flexible benefits, if appropriate;
  •    the importance attached to the non-financial rewards resulting from recognition of
        accomplishment, autonomy and the opportunity to develop.

Sexual harassment
The sexual harassment policy should state that:
  •     Sexual harassment will not be tolerated.
  •     Employees subjected to sexual harassment will be given advice, support and counsel-
        ling as required.
  •     Every attempt will be made to resolve the problem informally with the person com-

5.4.6 PERSPECTIVES

The balanced scorecard suggests that we view the organization from four perspectives, and to
develop metrics, collect data and analyze it relative to each of these perspectives:

    (i) THE LEARNING& GROWTH PERSPECTIVE

         This perspective includes employee training and corporate cultural attitudes related to both
         individual and corporate self-improvement. In any case, learning and growth constitute the
         essential foundation for success of any knowledge-worker organization.

    (ii) THE BUSINESS PROCESS PERSPECTIVE

         This perspective refers to internal business processes. Metrics based on this perspective
         allow the managers to know how well their business is running, and whether its products and
         services conform to customer requirements (the mission).

    (iii)THE CUSTOMER PERSPECTIVE

         Recent management philosophy has shown an increasing realization of the importance of

MANUAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCESSES, BENNETT UNIVERSITY                                   P a g e 60 | 93          customer focus and customer satisfaction in any business.

(iii)THE CUSTOMER PERSPECTIVE

         Recent management philosophy has shown an increasing realization of the importance of

MANUAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCESSES, BENNETT UNIVERSITY                                   P a g e 60 | 93          customer focus and customer satisfaction in any business. These are leading indicators: if
         customers are not satisfied, they will eventually find other suppliers that will meet their needs.
         Poor performance from this perspective is thus a leading indicator of future decline, even
         though the current financial picture may look good.

    (iv) THE FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE

         Timely and accurate funding data will always be a priority, and managers will do whatever
         necessary to provide it. In fact, often there is more than enough handling and processing of
         financial data. With the implementation of a corporate database, it is hoped that more of the
         processing can be centralized and automated. But the point is that the current emphasis on
         financials leads to the ""unbalanced"" situation with regard to other perspectives. There is
         perhaps a need to include additional financial-related data, such as risk assessment and
         cost-benefit data, in this category.

In January, all HODs shall submit their manpower requirement to respective Deans and the Head
HR for the following academic year with proper staffing pattern.

2.4.2     SUCCESSION PLANNING

This step involves identification of an internal employee as the possible successors to the key or
senior position if it is vacant or a will be rendered vacant. In this process Peon may be promoted as
Clerk, Laboratory Assistant may be promoted as a Technical Assistant, Clerk may be promoted as
Head clerk & office superintendent, etc. The succession can be absolute succession if the identified
candidate fulfils all conditions required for appointment. It is mandatory to have completed minimum
three years in previous post.

2.4.3     MANAGEMENT APPROVAL TO FILL UP VACANT POSITIONS

Once the vacancies are identified in respective position, the Dean shall seek Vice Chancellor’s
Approval to fill in the vacancies by raising an Employee requisition. The Dean shall clearly mention
the
1) reason for vacancies - position wise
2) the pay band and grade pay for each proposed vacancy to be filled. Such requests should reach
the Vice Chancellor in February each year for the following academic year.

2.4.4     ADVERTISEMENT OF VACANCIES

On receipt of the approval to fill the vacant positions, the Dean through Head HR shall advertise the
vacant post to invite applications. The advertisement shall be published on website. 15 days’ time
shall be given for the receipt of applications. HR can also explore other channels to source the
eligible candidates for various vacancies.

FOR EXAMPLE:
         Ex #1 If the organization’s vision is to have a turnover via admissions of X Crores, the
                 admission Leader’s biggest chunk of goal would be X. The same being the top-most
                 “Goal” can have a weightage of 50 percentage or thereabout. Now this goal directly
                 impacts the financial and business perspective of the Balance Score Card. This goal
                 will get further divided into achievable for each team member in the admission team.
         Ex #2 In HR Team, the person contributing in resourcing should have the largest chunk of
                 Goals in terms of positions closed within the TAT of 30 days from the raising of
                 requisition. This would directly impact (internal) customer, and business perspective
                 of Balance Score Card. Hence this would be approximately 50 percent weightage of
                 year’s target.
         Ex # 3 In Academics, a direct goal is number of man hours of sessions taken by the faculty.
                 It would also include the efficiency and effectiveness, in terms of bandwidth (breadth
                 and depth), relevance, method of delivery, and feedback of the students.

5.4.8    ASSESSMENT OF GOALS ACHIEVED & ITS’ ALIGNMENT

         1) The assessment of each goal is based on the weightage given to it.
         2) This assessment is first to be done by the Appraisee; what s/he has actually achieved,
             should be noted for each goal.
         3) The Appraiser and Reviewer may then review the assessment of the appraisee, and
             revise the scores given by him/her, if required.
         4) Please note that a goal should not have a weightage of more than 50 percent and should
             not be less than 10 percent. An ideal goal sheet should have 4-6 goals for the Annual
             Appraisal.

Budgeting, in the context of the document, refers to the preparation of an estimated manpower budget based on the school's compensation structure, including the per hire cost as part of the Annual Operating Plan (AOP). This budget is crucial for the recruitment process and requires management approval to ensure alignment with the university's strategic goals.","An Employee Requisition Form (ERF) is a document raised by the Dean and approved by the Vice Chancellor to initiate the recruitment process. It includes details such as the position(s) to be filled (e.g., Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor), the nature of the requirement (replacement or new), the number of positions, minimum qualifications and experience required, designation, certifications, and other relevant details. The ERF is essential for ensuring that recruitment aligns with the approved manpower budget and organizational structure.",BU_HR_Manual_.pdf_5 and IHVN-HR-Policy-Manual-Final-PCL.pdf_12 and BU_HR_Manual_.pdf_12 and BU_HR_Manual_.pdf_64,2024-09-16 15:19:24

                 EVALUATION OF RECRUITMENT CONSULTANTS:

                 The Head HR in consultation with the Dean invites quotations from various

                 current clientele, size of database, past performance records, feedback from peer
                 industries, and negotiated terms of engagement including cost per hire and

                 for final approval and decision to empanel the selected one. Accordingly, a mandate
                 is issued to the empaneled recruiter and a tenured contract (terms of engagement) is
                 drawn upon and agreed and signed by both the parties. The empaneled recruiter shall

     A good recruitment process is very important for your Foundation, but in more ways than you may
     think. The process itself speaks volumes about your company. It is a direct reflection of the validity and
     professionalism of your organization. Not only do your prospective employees as well as current
     employees use this as a standard of measure for your Foundation, your donuts, customers and the
     community do as well. This policy provides guidelines that will help to mitigate risk in the recruitment
     process. The policy and procedures below outline a recommended practice. Amend to fit your
     Foundation’s practices.

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation will endeavour to recruit the most competent individuals to fill all positions.

Procedure:
          1.    Approval to recruit for vacant or newly created positions will be granted by the (insert appropriate level
                of authority for your Foundation).

          2.    Job advertisements shall include the following information:

                     ●     Job Title

                     ●     Essential requirements for education and experience

                     ●     Knowledge and skills required

                     ●     Salary range

                     ●     Starting/ending date where applicable

                     ●     Hours of work

                     ●     Closing date of competition

                     ●     Respondent

                                                                                                        Policies and Procedures Template - Page 30 Selection

     Going through a systematic set of questions and even skills tests will determine if candidates are able
     to fulfill the job needs. This helps establish confidence in knowing that you have logically gone through
     a recruiting process and choose people based on defined metrics rather than gut feelings. When you
     do this, you increase your chances of having someone succeed in the job. If you don’t need to
     constantly replace people, you will save time and money on the recruiting and training of new
     candidates. Understand that downtime could negatively affect your Foundation’s revenues if you
     become short-staffed; keeping turnover low is important. There are costs and time spent putting out
     job ads, interviews and training new people. Taking the time to choose properly the first time helps
     mitigate this. Use this policy and procedures below as guidelines when developing your Foundation’s
     selection process. Amend to fit your Foundation’s practices.

                  Unit.

          grade, the employee shall be entitled to ten percent of his/her current basic pay as
          acting allowance.

                                                                                                65 | P a g e       Title:                                                             PROMOTION

                 EVALUATION OF RECRUITMENT CONSULTANTS:

                 The Head HR in consultation with the Dean invites quotations from various
                 Recruitment Consultants and prepares a comparative statement based on their

                 industries, and negotiated terms of engagement including cost per hire and
                 replacement duration. Such comparative analysis is submitted to the Vice Chancellor
                 for final approval and decision to empanel the selected one. Accordingly, a mandate
                 is issued to the empaneled recruiter and a tenured contract (terms of engagement) is
                 drawn upon and agreed and signed by both the parties. The empaneled recruiter shall
                 source suitable candidates (as per the job description) and send them for the interview
                 and selection process. Candidate, selected if any, shall be issued the Letter of

                 Chancellor’s approval copy and the contract (terms of engagement) of the empaneled
                 consultant to the Accounts Department for the purpose of payment. Annual evaluation
                 of the services provided by the existing Recruiter / Consultants is done to decide
                 termination/renewal of the contract.

    (v)      JOB PORTALS AND DIRECT SOURCING

             Sourcing of candidates may also take place through job portals subscribed from time to

              Chancellor, shall be forwarded to the newspapers/journals in which it is to be published.
              The Head HR will scrutinize the text of the advertisement and forward the same to the
              Marketing & Communication Department for preparation of the lay out and obtaining
              estimates. The Head HR, thereafter, obtains approval from the Accounts Department on

FACULTY RATIFICATION

To ensure all existing faculty members, who are recruited by college
selection committee, are ratified by JNTUA selection committee
complying with regulatory requirements. All faculty recruited by the
Selection Committee and whose names are recommended for
ratification shall have to attend the ratification interviews conducted by
the affiliating university (JNTUA) from time to time. The Institute shall
notify all eligible faculties to attend the ratification interviews as per the
JNTUA’s notified schedule.
The onus of meeting the standards of the ratification committee shall be
on the faculty. In case a faculty member fails to be ratified, his or her
annual appraisal period will be extended by six months or until the next
ratification interview, whichever is later. The annual increment in such
cases shall be released only after ratification in the subsequent batch. In
addition, such a faculty shall forego the DA which may be announced
during the extended appraisal period, and will be eligible for it only at
the end of the extended appraisal period.
While those who fail the ratification process the first time shall be
accorded a second chance, a second failure will cause a faculty’s services
to be terminated. In effect, a faculty shall be deemed to be on probation
for one year or until ratification, whichever is later.
A faculty who does not attend the ratification interview as required may
also invite termination. Only on serious medical grounds, with due
medical certificate, may a faculty seek exemption from attending a
ratification interview. In all such cases, the Principal shall be the deciding
authority.

Policies and Procedures Template - Page 31 Written Offer of Employment

     A job offer letter allows the employer to itemize the facts about the offer, outline the job’s
     responsibilities and highlight relevant details about the company. In the event that the candidate
     requests to negotiate issues like salary or vacation, the job offer letter serves as the critical reference
     point. A clearly written offer of employment is also a risk mitigant. The policy and procedures below
     outline a recommended practice. Amend to fit your Foundation’s practices.

Policy and Procedure Statement
All employees shall receive an employment package outlining the conditions of employment.

Procedures:
          1.    Once a verbal offer has been made and a verbal offer of acceptance has been received, a written offer
                of employment is prepared that includes:

                     ●    Position Title

                     ●    Job Description

                     ●    Hours of work

                     ●    Probationary period of ____ months

                     ●    Statement that candidate will uphold the bylaws of the foundation

                     ●    Specific conditions that may apply

          2.    Two copies of the offer of employment will be made. The potential employee will be requested to sign
                one and will be given the other for their personal records.

          3.    Upon receipt of written acceptance from the applicant, the Foundation will respond in writing to all
                unsuccessful applicants who were interviewed.

          4.    The employment package will include a copy of the Human Resources Policy and Procedure
                Handbook, Code of Ethics and Confidentiality policies, travel expense claim and the appropriate
                overtime tracking document.

The employee will sign a confirmation that the employee has read and understood the employee package.

                                                                                                        Policies and Procedures Template - Page 32 Orientation

     to make him/her more comfortable in the job, encourages employee confidence and helps the new
     employee adapt faster to the job, contributes to a more effective, productive workforce, improves
     employee retention; and promotes communication between the supervisor and the new employee. An
     effective orientation program is also a risk mitigant. The policy and procedure below is one example of
     a program. Amend to fit your Foundation’s practices.

Discipline
The disciplinary policy should state that employees have the right to know what is expected of
them and what could happen if they infringe the organization’s rules. It would also make the
point that, in handling disciplinary cases, the organization will treat employees in accordance
with the principles of natural justice. It should be supported by a disciplinary procedure (see
Chapter 61).

Diversity management
A policy on managing diversity recognizes that there are differences among employees and
that these differences, if properly managed, will enable work to be done more efficiently and
effectively. It does not focus exclusively on issues of discrimination but instead concentrates on
recognizing the differences between people. As Kandola and Fullerton (1994) express it, the
concept of managing diversity ‘is founded on the premise that harnessing these differences will
create a productive environment in which everyone will feel valued, where their talents are
fully utilized, and in which organizational goals are met’.
Managing diversity is a concept that recognizes the benefits to be gained from differences. It
differs from equal opportunity, which aims to legislate against discrimination, assumes that
people should be assimilated into the organization and, often, relies on affirmative action. This
point was emphasized by Mulholland et al (2005) as follows:

     The new diversity management thinking suggests that diversity management goes
     beyond the equal opportunities management considerations as described by the law,
     and promises to make a positive and strategic contribution to the successful operation
     of business. So diversity management is being hailed as a proactive, strategically rele-
     vant and results-focused approach and a welcome departure from the equal opportuni-
     ties approach, which has been defined as reactive, operational and sometimes
     counterproductive.

A management of diversity policy could: 992      HR Policies, Procedures and Systems

functions could be affected adversely, is the idea behind providing them
with the reasonable opportunity to take leave from their duties while
earning their salaries for such leave of absence. Keeping these aspects in
view the policy is designed/formulated.

given to the HOD through message or phone call and submit the Casual
Leave application immediately on resuming duty. Such facility is

human_resources_documents,what does support staff  include,"the contributions of non-teaching staff are integral to the smooth
         functioning and overall success of the organization. This policy outlines a clear and fair
         framework for promoting non-teaching staff based on merit, performance, and potential. By
         establishing transparent criteria and processes, we seek to ensure that all staff members are
         given equal opportunities to advance their careers, enhance their skills, and contribute more
         effectively to the institution's mission.

6.2.2     OBJECTIVE

         The objective of non-Teaching staff Promotion policy is to foster a supportive and motivating
         environment that acknowledges their efforts, nurtures their professional growth, and aligns
         their career progression with institutional goals.

6.2.3     ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

         A promotion is applicable to non-teaching staff members who have worked at the institution
         for three continuous years. Promotion is considered for more reasons than just finishing a
         certain number of services. Each eligible candidate must appear in front of the selection
         panel, which consists of the Vice Chancellor, VP & Head HR, and the Dean or Head of
         School/Department.

MANUAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES AND PROCESSES, BENNETT UNIVERSITY                                            P a g e 76 | 93 6.2.4 SELECTION PROCESS:

         •   All Eligible candidates will have to appear before the selection panel. The panel shall
             comprise of the Vice Chancellor, respective School Dean or Head of Department, Head-
             HR.
         •   Apart from the above eligibility criteria various other factors such as achievements of
             goals, feedback, skills and qualification, experience, job performance, contributions to
             the university, personal attributes like adaptability, professionalism etc.
         •   The panel will determine the candidates for promotion based on merit and the number of
             available vacant position in the school/department.
         •   The selection panel will submit the final list of selected candidates to the Hon’ble
             Chancellor for approval.
         •   Eligible non -teaching staff must submit the duly filled application form along with
             supporting documentary evidence (self- attested) to their respective Dean or Head of
             Departments.
         •   Upon receipt of the application Deans/Head of Departments may review them and
             provide recommendation.

These     entail,   for
instance, a positive attitude to staff, active information flow, and decentralisation of
power and responsibility. A manager shall normally seek to confer with co-workers on
matters concerning the workplace,              and seek to achieve a broad consensus. Managers
are responsible for the work of their staff. Managers are to work towards the objectives
which have been set.
The City of Reykjavík stresses that staff be punctual, and that they be at work at the
times agreed, which are stated in the contract of employment. Managers must monitor
employees’ attendance.
Employees are to perform their work meticulously and conscientiously in every way and
be polite, helpful and fair in their work. They are to work honourably with others towards
the objectives which have been set. They must comply with the lawful instructions of
their  superiors.     They    must    observe     confidentiality    regarding     matters     of  which    they
become aware in their work, and which are subject to confidentiality. This duty of
confidentiality remains in force after termination of employment. Employees should take
care that their conduct and behaviour is consistent with their position, and avoid any
action which would reflect upon them or their reputation, or which might bring discredit
upon the post or profession in which they work. Employees are to take care not to
accept     payment      or   other    goods     from    clients   which     could    be   interpreted     as    a
remuneration for a favour. They must maintain the highest standards of probity, integrity
and fairness in their work for the city.

6.   Institutions’ and companies’ action plans

Every other year, municipal agencies and companies must make an action plan for the
implementation of the human resource policy, in connection with the drawing up of work
and financial plans; this plan must be presented to staff and submitted to the Human
Resources Department. This shall include details of how the human resource policy is to

                                                                                                                6 be applied, and the measures envisaged for this purpose. At the end of each year
institutions and companies shall evaluate the success of the plan.

7.  Monitoring

The Human Resources Department supervises the personnel affairs of the City of
Reykjavík’s institutions and companies, and ensures that consistency is observed and
that decisions in personnel matters are consistent with overall objectives.

The Employees advance shall ensure that all the advances previously
drawn are fully settled.
The expense statement with bills shall initially be submitted to their HOD.
After the bills are certified by HOD and forward to the Principal for
approval then the employees shall submit the same to the Accounts
Department for further proceedings.

                  6. TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT
The Management strongly believes that continuous updating of
knowledge and technology is the hallmark of a teacher. To meet this
need, the institute encourages the departments to organize FDP and
Work Shop for the benefit of the faculty and also lends support when the
faculty wants to attend FDP and Work Shop in other reputed institutions.
STAFF INDUCTION PROGRAM
All newly joined employees upon completion of the formalities undergo
an induction program, intended to familiarize them with the dynamics
of the organization. The methodology would be that of guided
interaction with the various sections in the staff. In recognition of their
experience and expertise, senior staff members would often be asked to
participate as facilitators in the Induction Program, on a need basis. The
induction process may be phased over a few days so as not to disrupt the
daily work of staff and those conducting the induction. Training module
will be developed and put in place for induction process. The following
are to find place in the Training module.
1.     Explain the Vision, Mission and Guiding Principles of the college
2.     Explain the Vision, Mission and Guiding Principles of the
       department.
3.     Explain the PSOs and PEOs of the department.
4.     Provide access for the new employee to read the policy documents
       such as HR Manual, Handbook etc.
5.     Describe key office norms and policies, systems, manual of
       procedures etc.

6.     Appraise about the job description with the employee.
7.     Orientation on Faculty Appraisal System.

 CAPACITY BUILDING PLAN
A Capacity Building Need Analysis will be conducted internally by Internal
Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) at the beginning of the academic year, if
need with the help of external experts specifically looking into the job
requirements of each individual and scope of the job in the future.

Specific HR policies
The most common areas in which specific HR policies exist are age and employment, AIDS,
bullying, discipline, e-mails and the internet, employee development, employee relations,
employee voice, employment, equal opportunity, grievances, health and safety, managing
diversity, promotion, redundancy, reward, sexual harassment, substance abuse and work–life
balance.

Age and employment
The policy on age and employment should take into account the UK legislation on age dis-
crimination and the following facts:
  •    age is a poor predictor of job performance;
  •    it is misleading to equate physical and mental ability with age;
  •    more of the population are living active, healthy lives as they get older.

AIDS
An AIDS policy could include the following points:
  •    The risk through infection in the workplace is negligible.
  •    Where the occupation does involve blood contact, as in hospitals, doctors’ surgeries
       and laboratories, the special precautions advised by the Health and Safety Commission
       will be implemented.
  •    Employees who know that they are infected with HIV will not be obliged to disclose the
       fact to the company, but if they do, the fact will remain completely confidential.
  •    There will be no discrimination against anyone with or at risk of acquiring AIDS.
  •    Employees infected by HIV or suffering from AIDS will be treated no differently from
       anyone else suffering a severe illness.                                                                                                     HR Policies  991

Bullying
An anti-bullying policy will state that bullying will not be tolerated by the organization and
that those who persist in bullying their staff will be subject to disciplinary action, which could
be severe in particularly bad cases. The policy will make it clear that individuals who are being
bullied should have the right to discuss the problem with another person; a representative or a
member of the HR function, and to make a complaint. The policy should emphasize that if a
complaint is received it will be thoroughly investigated.

Discipline
The disciplinary policy should state that employees have the right to know what is expected of
them and what could happen if they infringe the organization’s rules. It would also make the
point that, in handling disciplinary cases, the organization will treat employees in accordance
with the principles of natural justice. It should be supported by a disciplinary procedure (see
Chapter 61).

FACULTY RATIFICATION

To ensure all existing faculty members, who are recruited by college
selection committee, are ratified by JNTUA selection committee
complying with regulatory requirements. All faculty recruited by the
Selection Committee and whose names are recommended for
ratification shall have to attend the ratification interviews conducted by
the affiliating university (JNTUA) from time to time. The Institute shall
notify all eligible faculties to attend the ratification interviews as per the
JNTUA’s notified schedule.
The onus of meeting the standards of the ratification committee shall be
on the faculty. In case a faculty member fails to be ratified, his or her
annual appraisal period will be extended by six months or until the next
ratification interview, whichever is later. The annual increment in such
cases shall be released only after ratification in the subsequent batch. In
addition, such a faculty shall forego the DA which may be announced
during the extended appraisal period, and will be eligible for it only at
the end of the extended appraisal period.
While those who fail the ratification process the first time shall be
accorded a second chance, a second failure will cause a faculty’s services
to be terminated. In effect, a faculty shall be deemed to be on probation
for one year or until ratification, whichever is later.
A faculty who does not attend the ratification interview as required may
also invite termination. Only on serious medical grounds, with due
medical certificate, may a faculty seek exemption from attending a
ratification interview. In all such cases, the Principal shall be the deciding
authority.

medical certificate, may a faculty seek exemption from attending a
ratification interview. In all such cases, the Principal shall be the deciding

8.2.1. Policy Objective
          -     To establish reasonable and consistent standards of behaviour contributing to
                effective work and high productivity; correct or eliminate inappropriate behaviour; and
                ensure the administration of disciplinary measures are fair, equitable and free of
                prejudice or favouritism.

8.2.2. Policy Statements
     8.2.2.1.     Employees’ performance and conduct should contribute to the achievement of the
                  Institute’s goals and objectives. When employee’s conduct or performance is
                  unsatisfactory or fails to meet expectations, corrective action may be taken using
                  progressive discipline. Serious offences may result in immediate suspension.
     8.2.2.2.     The disciplinary policy is to ensure that the highest standards of behaviour and
                  conduct are adhered to across the Institute at all times. Therefore, it is essential that
                  any alleged issue of unacceptable behaviour or misconduct is swiftly resolved.
     8.2.2.3.     IHVN’s disciplinary procedures will be subject to the laws of the Federal Republic of
                  Nigeria. Strict compliance with the code of ethics, rules and regulations will be
                  expected from all employees.
     8.2.2.4.     Disciplinary sanctions shall be corrective, commensurate to the offence.
     8.2.2.5.     It is the Institute’s intent to discipline employees only for “just cause”. Just cause

Section 13:Disciplinary Procedures

The Disciplinary Procedure will be used only when necessary and as LAST RESORT. Where
possible, informal or formal counseling or other good management practice will resolve the
matters prior to disciplinary action being taken.

The procedures is intended to be positive rather than punitive but takes cognizance of the fact
that sanctions may be applied in some circumstances. The new entrants will discussed any part
of the policy with their Reporting Officers. They can help clarify an employee rights as well as give
guidance and support where it may be needed.

The part of the Disciplinary Procedures will be distributed into following categories.

a) Suspension

b) Counseling

c) Warning

d) Termination

Suspension

Suspension is not disciplinary action, it is the cooling down period for employer or employee. The
purpose of suspension is manifold and can be used when it is necessary to remove an employee
from the workplace pending an investigation.

Above Hierarchy Level from the concerned position will have an authority to suspend an
individual. An employee suspended from duty will receive the written communication within three
days from the final meeting with the concern team.

a) Reason of Suspension

b) Date and Time from which the suspension will operate

c) Timescale of On-Going Investigation

The employee had a right to appeal to the immediate manager regarding the suspension reason
and also specify the relevant facts and figures if required.                                                                                        SPIL Corporate HR Policies

The suspension will be maximum done for 7 days and the “double” pay will be deducted for the
suspension period. For Example: If the employee will suspend on 4 days, then the 8 days salary
will be deducted.

After the mutual understanding of the employee and employer, the employee will resume the duty
and the apology letter will be given to the employer or any detail based upon the approval of the
Managing Director/Director.

If the suspension of the employee will be done two times in a year, then on the third time it will
be considered as “Termination” from the organisation.

Counseling

Counseling is an attempt to correct a situation and prevent it from getting worse without having
to use the disciplinary procedure and where improvement is required.

Specific HR policies
The most common areas in which specific HR policies exist are age and employment, AIDS,
bullying, discipline, e-mails and the internet, employee development, employee relations,
employee voice, employment, equal opportunity, grievances, health and safety, managing
diversity, promotion, redundancy, reward, sexual harassment, substance abuse and work–life
balance.

Age and employment
The policy on age and employment should take into account the UK legislation on age dis-
crimination and the following facts:
  •    age is a poor predictor of job performance;
  •    it is misleading to equate physical and mental ability with age;
  •    more of the population are living active, healthy lives as they get older.

AIDS
An AIDS policy could include the following points:
  •    The risk through infection in the workplace is negligible.
  •    Where the occupation does involve blood contact, as in hospitals, doctors’ surgeries
       and laboratories, the special precautions advised by the Health and Safety Commission
       will be implemented.
  •    Employees who know that they are infected with HIV will not be obliged to disclose the
       fact to the company, but if they do, the fact will remain completely confidential.
  •    There will be no discrimination against anyone with or at risk of acquiring AIDS.
  •    Employees infected by HIV or suffering from AIDS will be treated no differently from
       anyone else suffering a severe illness.                                                                                                     HR Policies  991

Bullying
An anti-bullying policy will state that bullying will not be tolerated by the organization and
that those who persist in bullying their staff will be subject to disciplinary action, which could
be severe in particularly bad cases. The policy will make it clear that individuals who are being
bullied should have the right to discuss the problem with another person; a representative or a
member of the HR function, and to make a complaint. The policy should emphasize that if a
complaint is received it will be thoroughly investigated.

Discipline
The disciplinary policy should state that employees have the right to know what is expected of
them and what could happen if they infringe the organization’s rules. It would also make the
point that, in handling disciplinary cases, the organization will treat employees in accordance
with the principles of natural justice. It should be supported by a disciplinary procedure (see
Chapter 61).

Policy and Procedure Statement
Employees are requested to provide written notice to their immediate supervisor of their intended resignation.

Employees giving notice or receiving notice of termination will receive a record of employment, together with all
wages outstanding, including any vacation pay accrued.

All cases of employer termination shall comply with provincial/federal employment standards legislation.

Issuing References

     No opinions on an employee’s competency or qualifications should come through a reference. Only
     standard issue HR information should be in the reference. True, the difficult burden of proving a former
     employee didn’t get a new job because of your reference lies with the employee, but a disgruntled
     employee could still make you litigate or alternatively the new employer could sue if the old manager
     didn’t mention something important. Having a neutral policy that applies to everyone means that your
     Board and lawyer sleep better at night.

Policy and Procedure Statement
It is the policy of the Foundation to respect the confidentiality of employee records and therefore discretion and
sensitivity are used when issuing references and employee verification.

Procedure:
Letters of reference will be issued at the request of the employee and will include employee name, title, dates of
employment, a brief overview of key tasks and accomplishments, and rate of pay (if requested by employee).

and __________ fifteen-minute breaks. The standard workweek is comprised of a maximum of ___________
hours per week. (adjust to align with your Foundation’s current practice)

If an employee is required to leave the Foundation during normal working hours, he/she is required to notify
co-workers, as well as the ED/CEO

All employees at the Foundation will be paid on a weekly/biweekly/monthly basis with the opportunity of a
mid-month advance.

Employees shall be required to submit a completed “Timesheet” in the attached form to the Chief Executive Officer
by the 26th of each month (adjust to fit your Foundation’s practices and pay periods).

Regular attendance and punctuality are an important part of an employee’s responsibility. Therefore, established
working hours shall be adhered to. Any lateness or absenteeism shall be reported as far in advance of starting time
as possible under unusual circumstances. Foundation employees are expected to telephone the office in these
circumstances.

The telephone voicemail system is an acceptable method for reporting lateness or absenteeism.

                                                                                                       Policies and Procedures Template - Page 11 Dress Code
     Include this policy if dress code at work matters to your Foundation.

Policy and Procedure Statement
Maintaining a professional, business-like appearance is very important to the success of the Foundation.

Regardless of the employee’s interaction with clients, customers, suppliers, contractors, or volunteers, each
employee projects the reputation of the organization. Part of this impression depends on each employee’s choice
of attire.

The Foundation has chosen to offer a casual dress environment for employees.

Regardless of the employee’s interaction with clients, customers, suppliers, contractors, or volunteers, each
employee projects the reputation of the organization. Part of this impression depends on each employee’s choice
of attire.

The Foundation has chosen to offer a casual dress environment for employees. Employees are expected to use
good judgment and to show courtesy to their co-workers by dressing in a manner that is presentable and
appropriate. At all times employees are asked to be cognizant that regardless of their interaction with clients,
customers, suppliers, contractors, or volunteers, the Foundation is still a place of business.

Should employees be asked to attend business meetings with clients, either in the Foundation offices or otherwise,
they should dress in appropriate business attire.

Overtime/Lieu Time
     This section needs to align with your provincial employment standards. The policy suggested is an
     approach that you can take but you may want to handle hours worked beyond the standard work week
     in a different way than the below policy suggests.

Policy and Procedure Statement
Overtime is considered to be anything over 8 hours worked in a day and excess of 44 hours in a week for full-time
employees.

The Foundation will grant time off for hours worked beyond what would be considered a standard work week. Any
hours worked in excess of 8 hours per day or 44 hours in a week will be banked at 1.5 times of the employee’s
actual hours worked. The time off will be taken at a time mutually agreeable to the ED/CEO and the employee(s). If
the accumulated time is not taken within six months, the employer will pay the overtime hours at the prescribed
rate of 1.5 times the employee’s regular wage.

The maximum time that an employee may claim is 12 hours per day of work time for out of town trips or
conferences.

Employees must be properly authorized to work overtime in advance as a condition for being credited for such
overtime, except in emergency situations where prior consent cannot be obtained. In such cases, the employee will
advise the ED/CEO of circumstances as soon as possible.

Employees shall be required to submit a completed “Overtime Approval Form” to the ED/CEO for approval.

Foundation’s should refer to their provincial Occupational Health and Safety regulations when
      developing this policy, links to which can be found in Appendix A.

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation acknowledges it has a duty under the current Occupational Health & Safety Legislation (insert
appropriate name of provincial legislation) and Federal Labour Standards to take all reasonable precautions to
protect all persons working on site, (employee, volunteers, board members, donors) and all visitors.

Fire exits are located throughout the premises. For everyone’s own safety, all persons should be familiar with the
locations of these exits and the most efficient route to exit in case of fire.

The Foundation will maintain all Statutory Health and Safety practices and implement such others as are consistent
with the needs and position as a charitable organization. All persons when on site are required to refrain from any
activity which may jeopardize the health and safety of others.

Employee, Volunteer and Contractors’ Rights
There are three basic rights for employees, volunteers and contractors under the joint responsibility health and
safety model:

           ●    The right to know about workplace safety hazards,

           ●    The right to refuse unsafe work if they have “reasonable cause to believe the work is dangerous”,

           ●    The right to participate in the occupational health and safety process.

Employee, Volunteer and Contractors’ Obligations
Maintaining a safe work environment requires the continuous cooperation of all employees, volunteers and
contractors.

           ●    They must recognize that it is their duty to comply with all Health and Safety rules, regulations and
                guidelines.

                                                                                                        Policies and Procedures Template - Page 26            ●    They are required to refrain from any unsafe practices or hazardous actions and to exercise due care
                and diligence.

           ●    Any unsafe conditions, materials or equipment and all accidents or injuries must be reported to the
                ED/CEO.

Fitness for Duty

     This policy refers to the use of drugs and alcohol while on duty. There may be instances where this is
     permitted. Given the legalization of cannabis, the clarity of this policy is critical. The policy below
     provides direction on when, and when not, such use is acceptable. FOundations need to reflect on
     each of the statements to ensure that they comply with their values, principles and practices that are
     acceptable in their community.

The retirement policy states that an employee will retire from the organization upon reaching 60 years of age, with the effective date of retirement being the last day of the calendar month in which the employee turns 60.","The dress code policy at the Foundation emphasizes maintaining a professional, business-like appearance, which is important for the organization's success.

human_resources_documents,what is volunteer  use of own auto in community foundation of canada,"It is recognized that other distractions occur during driving, however the use of cell phones, while driving, is strictly
prohibited by the Foundation. Therefore, employees are required to stop their vehicle in a safe location so that they
can safely use a cell phone or similar device.

The Foundation is aware that employees utilize their personal cellular phones for business purposes. At the same
time, cell phones are a distraction in the workplace. To ensure the effectiveness of meetings, and as a professional
courtesy to others, employees are asked to leave cell phones at their desk. Or, on the unusual occasion of an
emergency or anticipated emergency that requires immediate attention, the cell phone may be carried to the
meeting on vibrate mode.

                                                                                                            Policies and Procedures Template - Page 18 Insurance for Employee or Volunteer Use of Own Auto

      Most foundations are not in a position to own or lease vehicles, which means employees are using
      their own vehicles for foundation business. The purpose of this policy is to outline the employee’s and
      the Foundation’s insurance coverage when an employee uses their own vehicle for Foundation
      business. In this instance the Foundation’s insurance coverage must include non-owned auto. The
      policy also applies to volunteers using their automobile on Foundation business. The Foundation’s
      non-owned auto coverage limit needs to be substituted for the limits in the policy below. The
      Foundation also needs to get confirmation from their employee or volunteer that they are suitably
      insured.

Policy and Procedure Statement
When an employee or volunteer is using a personal vehicle while on Foundation business, their personal auto
insurance is the primary insurer. The Foundation’s limit for non-owned automobiles is $2 million. This is paid in
excess of the underlying automobile insurance for the owner of said vehicle.

For example, if the employee has an underlying liability limit of $1 million (as is typical) and uses a personal vehicle
for Foundation purposes and a claim is substantiated in the amount of $2.5 million, the owner’s automobile policy
would pick up the first $1 million and the Foundation’s insurance would pick up the additional $1.5 million.

Contact with media

      Media relations are important for the Foundation as this gets your name out in the public
      consciousness and informs the community of your Foundation’s impact, your programs, mission, and
      identity. Having a media relations policy helps to mitigate reputational risk.

C.    Where the possibility of a conflict of interest exists, an employee should discuss these activities with
                the ED/CEO prior to engaging in such activities.

          D.    The outside employment should not embarrass or discredit the Foundation.

          E.    Soliciting Foundation donors and volunteers for outside employment is strictly prohibited.

Participation in Community Activities

     Does your Foundation encourage employees to participate in community activities? If so, refer to the
     below policy. If not, this policy is not necessary.

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation strongly encourages individuals to participate in community activities that promote the general
welfare of the community. Employees, who participate in such activities on or off Foundation time, must recognize
that they are representatives of the Foundation and should act accordingly.

                                                                                                         Policies and Procedures Template - Page 14 Solicitation on Foundation property

     Does your Foundation permit solicitation on your property? If so, refer to the below policy.

Policy and Procedure Statement
Foundation employees must demonstrate their dedication during the performance of job responsibilities to ensure
the fulfillment of the goals and objectives of the Foundation.

           A.   Employees must refrain from any activity directed toward private gain during working hours. Normal
                working hours do not include unpaid break periods.

           B.   Collection of gifts for fellow employees and Foundation supported solicitations, for sale of merchandise
                raffle tickets, club memberships or organizations is permitted provided the time does not interfere
                significantly with the productivity of employees and the activity has been approved by the ED/CEO.

Personal Use of Foundation Equipment

     Does your Foundation permit employees, under certain circumstances, to use Foundation equipment
     for personal use? If so, refer to the below policy.

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation’s resources should be used for the benefit of the Foundation and not for personal financial gain.
Employees will be allowed personal use of Foundation equipment only when:

           A.   Advance approval by ED/CEO is obtained.

           B.   The item is portable.

           C.   The item is non-consumable.

           D.   The cost to the Foundation is negligible.

Use of Foundation resources for community or charitable activities must be approved in advance by the ED/CEO.

                                                                                                      Policies and Procedures Template - Page 15 Accuracy of Record

      This policy is critical as it mitigates risk and limits the liability of the Foundation.

Full-Time & Part-Time Employees: Salary, benefits and vacation will be confirmed at time of employment and
reviewed annually.

ED/CEO: Salary, benefits and vacation will be as negotiated through an employment contract and reviewed
annually.

      Some Foundations provide additional benefits to their employees, such as group insurance, RRSPs or
      parking. Participating in existing group medical coverage is more cost effective. The local Chamber of
      Commerce has such coverage. Many provinces have similar group programs for non-profit
      organizations. Below are some sample clauses for benefits.

                                                                                                       Policies and Procedures Template - Page 20 Group Insurance Benefits: note: if your foundation provides group insurance, enter the parameters into this
paragraph, including who pays the premium and when the group insurance starts for new employees.

One component of the Group Insurance plan is an Employee Assistance Program which provides up to 12 hours of
face to face counseling per year, per employee.

If the Foundation is still enrolled with the Chamber of Commerce Group Insurance Plan, upon retirement, executive
staff, who have been enrolled in the plan for 2 years and who have been employed for 5 years, are eligible to enroll
in the Health and Dental benefit program for retiring Chambers of Commerce Insurance Plan for owners and
principals. The premiums for this plan are the responsibility of the retiring executive.

RRSP: Upon successful completion of the probationary period, full-time and part-time employees are entitled to
receive a 4% contribution per pay period towards a self-directed RRSP. There is also an opportunity for employees
to contribute to the same self-directed RRSP.

Parking: Upon successful completion of the probationary period, full-time employees are entitled to have their
parking paid for by the Foundation. Part-time employees are entitled to receive $40 per month towards parking or
bus pass (upon submission of receipts).

Vacation

     Employees need a break from work every now and then in order to maintain their physical and mental
     health. A number of studies have shown that taking time away from the job can have physical and
     psychological health benefits. People who take vacation have lower stress, less risk of heart disease, a
     better outlook on life, and more motivation to achieve goals. Taking vacations also provides employees
     the opportunity to get more sleep, which leads to better brain function and improved performance
     upon their return.

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation values professional development for its employees and will budget annually for such opportunities.

From time to time employees will be requested to take up-grading courses or other courses related to their
position. The Foundation shall pay flights and accommodations (if required), as well as tuition costs for these
courses. The Foundation shall pay for a regular day of work only, travel time is not paid. Employees will be
responsible for all meals and incidentals. All courses must have prior written approval from the ED/CEO.

Leave of Absence

     Leave of absence policies are meant to provide employees with work-life balance and, in certain
     circumstances, to give employees needed time away from work in urgent and compelling
     circumstances. Your provinces’ Employment Standards Act prescribes specific instances when leave
     must be granted. Appendix A provides links to provincial ESAs.

Policy and Procedure Statement
It is the policy of the Foundation to comply with the Employment Standards Code, and the Foundation reserves the
right to change its policy without notice if there is a change in such law. Due to the complexities of family and
medical leaves, it is important to contact the ED/CEO regarding specific leave requirement requests.

Requests for leave are accepted for the following periods of unpaid leave:

Emergency Leave: An employee may receive up to ten days of leave to attend to family emergencies. This leave
will be unpaid, but will not affect seniority, benefits or the employee’s position. This leave will comply with the
Employment Standards Act. The ten days do not have to be taken consecutively. The employee must inform their
employer as soon as possible if they will need to take any of these days off. The employer has the right to ask for
proof of the emergency.

Personal Leave: A personal leave may be granted on a limited basis depending on business needs. This leave will
be unpaid. This leave complies with the Employment Standards Code. If an intermittent or reduced leave is

                                                                                                        Policies and Procedures Template - Page 23 requested on this basis, the Foundation may require the employee to temporarily transfer to an alternative position
with equivalent pay and benefits which better accommodate the intermittent or leave schedule.

Medical/Disability Leave: An employee may be granted a medical leave because of a serious health condition or
non-work-related injury due to an accident. This leave complies with the Employment Standards Code.

If an intermittent or reduced leave is

                                                                                                        Policies and Procedures Template - Page 23 requested on this basis, the Foundation may require the employee to temporarily transfer to an alternative position
with equivalent pay and benefits which better accommodate the intermittent or leave schedule.

Medical/Disability Leave: An employee may be granted a medical leave because of a serious health condition or
non-work-related injury due to an accident. This leave complies with the Employment Standards Code. As a
condition of the employee returning from a leave because of the employee’s own serious health condition, the
Foundation may require medical certification from his/her health care provider that the employee is able to resume
work. This leave may be paid or unpaid according to the short-term disability policy provisions for the Foundation.

Pregnancy/Parental Leave: As per the Employment Standards Code.

Parental Leave for Birth and Adopting Parents: As per the Employment Standards Code.

Family Responsibility Leave: As per the Employment Standards Code.

Bereavement Leave: As per the Employment Standards Code.

Compassionate Care Leave: As per the Employment Standards Code.

Bereavement Leave: As per the Employment Standards Code.

Jury Duty: As per the Employment Standards Code.

Reservists’ Leave: As per the Employment Standards Code.

Sick Leave

     Sick days reduce turnover. Studies have shown that companies that offer paid sick leave see a
     reduction in employee turnover somewhere between 3.61% to 6.43%. Low turnover maintains
     consistent productivity, boosts employee engagement and morale, and builds a sense of unity
     between staff and managers. Foundations are encouraged to include this policy within their document
     as it provides clarity for handling employee absence due to illness. The following policy can form the
     basis of one developed for your Foundation.

Policy and Procedure Statement
This policy applies to bona fide non-occupational illnesses and injuries. The accumulation of sick leave time allows
continuation of full base pay plus benefits when an eligible employee is required to be absent from work because
of non-occupational illnesses, injuries or medical conditions.

Sick leave is accrued based on a staff member’s regularly scheduled hours of work. A full-time employee accrues
sick leave at the rate of ten days each calendar year. A regular part time employee accrues sick leave on a pro-rata
basis.

Any employee found to be in violation of the preceding paragraph will be subject to disciplinary action which may
include termination of employment.

                                                                                                          Policies and Procedures Template - Page 28 SECTION 6

The Community Foundation of Canada allows employees and volunteers to use their personal vehicles for Foundation business. In this case, the personal auto insurance of the employee or volunteer is the primary insurer. The Foundation provides non-owned auto coverage with a limit of $2 million, which applies in excess of the individual's underlying automobile insurance. Additionally, the Foundation requires confirmation that the employee or volunteer is suitably insured when using their own vehicle for Foundation purposes.","The policy and procedure for leave of absence in the Community Foundations of Canada includes several types of unpaid leave to support employees in urgent and compelling circumstances.

     A good recruitment process is very important for your Foundation, but in more ways than you may
     think. The process itself speaks volumes about your company. It is a direct reflection of the validity and
     professionalism of your organization. Not only do your prospective employees as well as current
     employees use this as a standard of measure for your Foundation, your donuts, customers and the
     community do as well. This policy provides guidelines that will help to mitigate risk in the recruitment
     process. The policy and procedures below outline a recommended practice. Amend to fit your
     Foundation’s practices.

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation will endeavour to recruit the most competent individuals to fill all positions.

Procedure:
          1.    Approval to recruit for vacant or newly created positions will be granted by the (insert appropriate level
                of authority for your Foundation).

          2.    Job advertisements shall include the following information:

                     ●     Job Title

                     ●     Essential requirements for education and experience

                     ●     Knowledge and skills required

                     ●     Salary range

                     ●     Starting/ending date where applicable

                     ●     Hours of work

                     ●     Closing date of competition

                     ●     Respondent

     Going through a systematic set of questions and even skills tests will determine if candidates are able
     to fulfill the job needs. This helps establish confidence in knowing that you have logically gone through
     a recruiting process and choose people based on defined metrics rather than gut feelings. When you
     do this, you increase your chances of having someone succeed in the job. If you don’t need to
     constantly replace people, you will save time and money on the recruiting and training of new
     candidates. Understand that downtime could negatively affect your Foundation’s revenues if you
     become short-staffed; keeping turnover low is important. There are costs and time spent putting out
     job ads, interviews and training new people. Taking the time to choose properly the first time helps
     mitigate this. Use this policy and procedures below as guidelines when developing your Foundation’s
     selection process. Amend to fit your Foundation’s practices.

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation will conduct a selection process that is fair and equitable.

Procedures:
           1.   It is the responsibility of each applicant to demonstrate that he/she meets the requirements of the
                position.

           2.   For support employees positions the appropriate supervisor receives and reviews all applications;
                those that meet the requirements will be contacted for interviews. The supervisor will conduct
                interviews. There may be instances where a second individual participates in the interview. This
                individual will be determined by the supervisor in consultation with the ED/CEO.

           3.   In the event that a new ED/CEO must be hired, the applications will be received and reviewed by the
                Board of Directors or the Board Hiring Committee. For this position, the Board of Directors will choose
                a Hiring Committee that consists of a minimum of three persons. (note: this clause should be discussed
                by the full board and amended accordingly).

           4.   A short list of applicants that meet the basic requirements will be invited to an interview.

           5.   Second interviews will be held when several candidates demonstrate equal abilities.

           6.   Once a final candidate has been determined a verbal offer of employment can be made, except if the
                position being filled is that of the ED/CEO, in which case the Board of Directors must give approval.
                Following receipt of approval to hire, a verbal offer can be made to the candidate. IT should be noted
                that a verbal offer is legally binding on the Foundation.

                                                                                                           Policies and Procedures Template - Page 31 Written Offer of Employment

     A job offer letter allows the employer to itemize the facts about the offer, outline the job’s
     responsibilities and highlight relevant details about the company. In the event that the candidate
     requests to negotiate issues like salary or vacation, the job offer letter serves as the critical reference
     point. A clearly written offer of employment is also a risk mitigant.

Introduction to the Template
and Human Resource Policies

Objectives of the Template
This template is provided as a tool for community foundations to develop policies on all matters related to
conditions of employment. There are parts of this policy which also apply to volunteers and individuals working on
contract. Those policies that do not apply to volunteers and contractors will be so noted at the beginning of each
policy.

Employment-related legislation is a provincial responsibility. All parts of this document are supplementary to
applicable federal and provincial legislation. In the event of conflict, such legislation will prevail. Appendix A
provides links to legislation in each province and territory. There will be references throughout this document
where it is necessary to adapt this policy to align with said legislation.

There will also be notations throughout this policy where local community foundation specific information needs to
be inserted.

At the beginning of each policy there is a shaded text box that provides rationale as to why the policy is important,
especially from a risk mitigation perspective. The box also includes guidance on adapting the policy for your
foundation’s use. When developing your foundation’s policies, these text boxes can be removed, unless you would
like to include them as part of the rationale for each of the policies.

For some community foundations, the senior staff member is the Executive Director (ED) and for others the title is
Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

The policy and procedure for leave of absence in the Community Foundations of Canada includes several types of unpaid leave to support employees in urgent and compelling circumstances. The Foundation complies with the Employment Standards Code and reserves the right to change its policy if there are changes in the law. 

The types of leave include:

1. **Emergency Leave**: Up to ten days for family emergencies, unpaid but does not affect seniority, benefits, or position. Employees must inform their employer as soon as possible and may be required to provide proof of the emergency.

2. **Personal Leave**: Granted on a limited basis depending on business needs, this leave is also unpaid. The Foundation may require a temporary transfer to an alternative position to accommodate the leave schedule.

3. **Medical/Disability Leave**: For serious health conditions or non-work-related injuries. This leave may be paid or unpaid based on the Foundation's short-term disability policy, and medical certification may be required for return to work.

4. **Pregnancy/Parental Leave**: As per the Employment Standards Code.

5. **Family Responsibility Leave**: As per the Employment Standards Code.

6. **Bereavement Leave**: As per the Employment Standards Code.

7. **Compassionate Care Leave**: As per the Employment Standards Code.

8. **Jury Duty**: As per the Employment Standards Code.

9. **Reservists’ Leave**: As per the Employment Standards Code.

For specific leave requests, employees are encouraged to contact the Executive Director or Chief Executive Officer.","The recruitment procedure in community foundations in Canada includes the following steps:

1. **Approval to Recruit**: Approval for vacant or newly created positions must be granted by the appropriate level of authority within the Foundation.

2. **Job Advertisements**: Job postings must include essential information such as:
   - Job Title
   - Essential requirements for education and experience
   - Required knowledge and skills
   - Salary range
   - Starting/ending date (if applicable)
   - Hours of work
   - Closing date for applications
   - Contact information for responses

3. **Application Review**: Applications are reviewed by the appropriate supervisor, who will contact candidates that meet the requirements for interviews. A second individual may participate in the interview process if deemed necessary.

4. **Interview Process**: A shortlist of applicants who meet the basic requirements will be invited for interviews. If multiple candidates demonstrate equal abilities, second interviews may be conducted.

5. **Job Offer**: Once a final candidate is selected, a verbal offer of employment can be made. For positions like the Executive Director or CEO, the Board of Directors must approve the hire before a verbal offer is extended.

6. **Written Offer of Employment**: A job offer letter will be provided to outline the job responsibilities and relevant details, serving as a reference point for any negotiations regarding salary or other terms.

Throughout the process, the Foundation ensures that the recruitment, selection, and hiring practices are fair, consistent, and confidential.",HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_28 and HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_29 and HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_30 and HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_2,2024-09-16 17:15:27

All employees shall receive an employment package outlining the conditions of employment.

Procedures:
          1.    Once a verbal offer has been made and a verbal offer of acceptance has been received, a written offer
                of employment is prepared that includes:

                unsuccessful applicants who were interviewed.

          4.    The employment package will include a copy of the Human Resources Policy and Procedure
                Handbook, Code of Ethics and Confidentiality policies, travel expense claim and the appropriate
                overtime tracking document.

The employee will sign a confirmation that the employee has read and understood the employee package.

                                                                                                        Policies and Procedures Template - Page 32 Orientation

     Orientation is important because it provides the new employee with concise and accurate information
     to make him/her more comfortable in the job, encourages employee confidence and helps the new
     employee adapt faster to the job, contributes to a more effective, productive workforce, improves
     employee retention; and promotes communication between the supervisor and the new employee. An
     effective orientation program is also a risk mitigant. The policy and procedure below is one example of
     a program. Amend to fit your Foundation’s practices.

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation recognizes the importance of providing essential information to newly hired employees.

Understand that downtime could negatively affect your Foundation’s revenues if you
     become short-staffed; keeping turnover low is important. There are costs and time spent putting out
     job ads, interviews and training new people. Taking the time to choose properly the first time helps
     mitigate this. Use this policy and procedures below as guidelines when developing your Foundation’s
     selection process. Amend to fit your Foundation’s practices.

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation will conduct a selection process that is fair and equitable.

Procedures:
           1.   It is the responsibility of each applicant to demonstrate that he/she meets the requirements of the
                position.

           2.   For support employees positions the appropriate supervisor receives and reviews all applications;
                those that meet the requirements will be contacted for interviews. The supervisor will conduct
                interviews. There may be instances where a second individual participates in the interview. This
                individual will be determined by the supervisor in consultation with the ED/CEO.

           3.   In the event that a new ED/CEO must be hired, the applications will be received and reviewed by the
                Board of Directors or the Board Hiring Committee. For this position, the Board of Directors will choose
                a Hiring Committee that consists of a minimum of three persons. (note: this clause should be discussed
                by the full board and amended accordingly).

           4.   A short list of applicants that meet the basic requirements will be invited to an interview.

           5.   Second interviews will be held when several candidates demonstrate equal abilities.

           6.   Once a final candidate has been determined a verbal offer of employment can be made, except if the
                position being filled is that of the ED/CEO, in which case the Board of Directors must give approval.
                Following receipt of approval to hire, a verbal offer can be made to the candidate. IT should be noted
                that a verbal offer is legally binding on the Foundation.

                                                                                                           Policies and Procedures Template - Page 31 Written Offer of Employment

     A job offer letter allows the employer to itemize the facts about the offer, outline the job’s
     responsibilities and highlight relevant details about the company. In the event that the candidate
     requests to negotiate issues like salary or vacation, the job offer letter serves as the critical reference
     point. A clearly written offer of employment is also a risk mitigant.

Policy and Procedure Statement
Employees are requested to provide written notice to their immediate supervisor of their intended resignation.

Employees giving notice or receiving notice of termination will receive a record of employment, together with all
wages outstanding, including any vacation pay accrued.

All cases of employer termination shall comply with provincial/federal employment standards legislation.

Issuing References

     No opinions on an employee’s competency or qualifications should come through a reference. Only
     standard issue HR information should be in the reference. True, the difficult burden of proving a former
     employee didn’t get a new job because of your reference lies with the employee, but a disgruntled
     employee could still make you litigate or alternatively the new employer could sue if the old manager
     didn’t mention something important. Having a neutral policy that applies to everyone means that your
     Board and lawyer sleep better at night.

Policy and Procedure Statement
It is the policy of the Foundation to respect the confidentiality of employee records and therefore discretion and
sensitivity are used when issuing references and employee verification.

Procedure:
Letters of reference will be issued at the request of the employee and will include employee name, title, dates of
employment, a brief overview of key tasks and accomplishments, and rate of pay (if requested by employee).

                                                                                                      Policies and Procedures Template - Page 41                APPENDIX A

Introduction to the Template
and Human Resource Policies

Objectives of the Template
This template is provided as a tool for community foundations to develop policies on all matters related to
conditions of employment. There are parts of this policy which also apply to volunteers and individuals working on
contract. Those policies that do not apply to volunteers and contractors will be so noted at the beginning of each
policy.

Employment-related legislation is a provincial responsibility. All parts of this document are supplementary to
applicable federal and provincial legislation. In the event of conflict, such legislation will prevail. Appendix A
provides links to legislation in each province and territory. There will be references throughout this document
where it is necessary to adapt this policy to align with said legislation.

There will also be notations throughout this policy where local community foundation specific information needs to
be inserted.

At the beginning of each policy there is a shaded text box that provides rationale as to why the policy is important,
especially from a risk mitigation perspective. The box also includes guidance on adapting the policy for your
foundation’s use. When developing your foundation’s policies, these text boxes can be removed, unless you would
like to include them as part of the rationale for each of the policies.

For some community foundations, the senior staff member is the Executive Director (ED) and for others the title is
Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

The recruitment procedure in community foundations in Canada includes the following steps:

1. **Approval to Recruit**: Approval for vacant or newly created positions must be granted by the appropriate level of authority within the Foundation.

2. **Job Advertisements**: Job postings must include essential information such as:
   - Job Title
   - Essential requirements for education and experience
   - Required knowledge and skills
   - Salary range
   - Starting/ending date (if applicable)
   - Hours of work
   - Closing date for applications
   - Contact information for responses

3. **Application Review**: Applications are reviewed by the appropriate supervisor, who will contact candidates that meet the requirements for interviews. A second individual may participate in the interview process if deemed necessary.

4. **Interview Process**: A shortlist of applicants who meet the basic requirements will be invited for interviews. If multiple candidates demonstrate equal abilities, second interviews may be conducted.

5. **Job Offer**: Once a final candidate is selected, a verbal offer of employment can be made. For positions like the Executive Director or CEO, the Board of Directors must approve the hire before a verbal offer is extended.

6. **Written Offer of Employment**: A job offer letter will be provided to outline the job responsibilities and relevant details, serving as a reference point for any negotiations regarding salary or other terms.

Throughout the process, the Foundation ensures that the recruitment, selection, and hiring practices are fair, consistent, and confidential.","The procedure for a written offer of employment in community foundations in Canada includes the following steps:

1. **Preparation of Written Offer**: After a verbal offer has been made and accepted, a written offer of employment is prepared. This document includes:
   - Position Title
   - Job Description
   - Salary & Benefits
   - Vacation Entitlement
   - Starting Date
   - Hours of Work
   - Probationary Period
   - Statement regarding upholding the foundation's bylaws
   - Any specific conditions that may apply

2. **Copies of the Offer**: Two copies of the offer are made. The potential employee signs one copy and retains the other for their records.

3. **Response to Unsuccessful Applicants**: Upon receiving written acceptance from the applicant, the Foundation will respond in writing to all unsuccessful applicants who were interviewed.

4. **Employment Package**: The employment package will include the Human Resources Policy and Procedure Handbook, Code of Ethics, Confidentiality policies, travel expense claim, and overtime tracking document. The employee must sign a confirmation that they have read and understood the package.

This structured approach ensures clarity and serves as a reference point for any negotiations regarding the employment terms.",HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_31 and HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_30 and HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_41 and HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_2,2024-09-16 17:18:18
human_resources_documents,what is vacation schedule for full-time emplyoee in community foundationas of canada,"Each
employee will take scheduled vacation time off per the following:

           ●    After completing one full year of service                        ten working days

           ●    Five to ten years continuous service                             fifteen working days

           ●    More than ten years of service                                   twenty working days

Policy and Procedure Statement (earning vacation days)
Full-time Employees – The Foundation pays vacation time to full-time employees. Vacation should be taken in full
during the employment year. Cash payments will not be made in lieu of vacation except upon termination of
employment.

Vacation Schedule

           ●    After completing one full year of service                        2 weeks

           ●    5 – 10 years continuous service                                  3 weeks (after completion of the 5th year)

           ●    more than 10 years of service                                    4 weeks (after completion of the 10th year)

Part-time Employees – Part-time employees will accumulate one day per month in lieu of payment of 4% vacation
pay. The day is equivalent to the normal number of hours regularly worked by the employee.

It is understood all part-time employees are required to take a minimum two (2) weeks of vacation time, either paid
or unpaid, during the vacation period in accordance with the Employment Standards Act (ensure that this clause
aligns with your provincial legislation).

If the accumulated vacation credit is not used by the employee’s anniversary date, then it will be paid out to the
employee.

                                                                                                         Policies and Procedures Template - Page 22 Professional Development

     Employees are your Foundation’s most important asset. Their training and development is something
     in which your Foundation should invest. By training employees and investing in their career
     development you can make them feel valued by the Foundation. Offering professional development
     training programs and opportunities allows employees to perform better and prepares them for
     positions of greater responsibility. But it can also help employers attract top job candidates, retain their
     best workers and identify future leaders.

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation values professional development for its employees and will budget annually for such opportunities.

From time to time employees will be requested to take up-grading courses or other courses related to their
position. The Foundation shall pay flights and accommodations (if required), as well as tuition costs for these
courses. The Foundation shall pay for a regular day of work only, travel time is not paid. Employees will be
responsible for all meals and incidentals.

Full-Time & Part-Time Employees: Salary, benefits and vacation will be confirmed at time of employment and
reviewed annually.

ED/CEO: Salary, benefits and vacation will be as negotiated through an employment contract and reviewed
annually.

      Some Foundations provide additional benefits to their employees, such as group insurance, RRSPs or
      parking. Participating in existing group medical coverage is more cost effective. The local Chamber of
      Commerce has such coverage. Many provinces have similar group programs for non-profit
      organizations. Below are some sample clauses for benefits.

                                                                                                       Policies and Procedures Template - Page 20 Group Insurance Benefits: note: if your foundation provides group insurance, enter the parameters into this
paragraph, including who pays the premium and when the group insurance starts for new employees.

One component of the Group Insurance plan is an Employee Assistance Program which provides up to 12 hours of
face to face counseling per year, per employee.

If the Foundation is still enrolled with the Chamber of Commerce Group Insurance Plan, upon retirement, executive
staff, who have been enrolled in the plan for 2 years and who have been employed for 5 years, are eligible to enroll
in the Health and Dental benefit program for retiring Chambers of Commerce Insurance Plan for owners and
principals. The premiums for this plan are the responsibility of the retiring executive.

RRSP: Upon successful completion of the probationary period, full-time and part-time employees are entitled to
receive a 4% contribution per pay period towards a self-directed RRSP. There is also an opportunity for employees
to contribute to the same self-directed RRSP.

Parking: Upon successful completion of the probationary period, full-time employees are entitled to have their
parking paid for by the Foundation. Part-time employees are entitled to receive $40 per month towards parking or
bus pass (upon submission of receipts).

Vacation

     Employees need a break from work every now and then in order to maintain their physical and mental
     health. A number of studies have shown that taking time away from the job can have physical and
     psychological health benefits. People who take vacation have lower stress, less risk of heart disease, a
     better outlook on life, and more motivation to achieve goals. Taking vacations also provides employees
     the opportunity to get more sleep, which leads to better brain function and improved performance
     upon their return.

Holiday pay will be calculated at five percent of wages the four weeks immediately preceding the holiday.
Employees will not receive General Holiday Pay if the holiday falls on a day that they are not scheduled to be
working i.e. Saturday, except when July 1 lands on a Sunday then Monday is the designated holiday. This affects or
could affect Christmas, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day. (this clause needs to align with your provincial legislation -
however it could be improved upon based on your Foundation’s current practice)

Personnel Confidentiality
Policy and Procedure Statement
Each employee or applicant for employment has the right to have all information about him/her kept strictly
confidential. No personnel file or any other employee report shall be disclosed without the written permission of
the employee. (this clause needs to align with provincial privacy legislation affecting employees – see appendix A
for links)

                                                                                                        Policies and Procedures Template - Page 13 Outside Employment

     Foundations should read through the below policy statement and adapt it to fit their current practices.
     If a Foundation has never considered this type of policy, the following questions help with framing: Are
     we willing to let staff use Foundation equipment for outside activities? Are we able to limit our
     employees working at other organizations, and if so, are there any limitations that we could legally
     impose? What is our position in staff soliciting donors and volunteers for outside employment?

Policy and Procedure Statement
The Foundation recognizes the right of its employees to privacy and to make use of personal time outside of
working hours as they see fit. However, outside employment opportunities should be carefully considered to
ensure the employee’s ability to perform their responsibilities at the Foundation are not adversely affected.
Employees may engage in outside employment that complies with the following:

          A.    All outside employment and associated activities must be kept separate from the employee’s
                Foundation responsibilities.

          B.    Employees are prohibited from using time, tools, equipment, materials, personnel or information
                obtained through the Foundation for outside activities.

          C.    Where the possibility of a conflict of interest exists, an employee should discuss these activities with
                the ED/CEO prior to engaging in such activities.

          D.    The outside employment should not embarrass or discredit the Foundation.

          E.    Soliciting Foundation donors and volunteers for outside employment is strictly prohibited.

Participation in Community Activities

     Does your Foundation encourage employees to participate in community activities?

A number of studies have shown that taking time away from the job can have physical and
     psychological health benefits. People who take vacation have lower stress, less risk of heart disease, a
     better outlook on life, and more motivation to achieve goals. Taking vacations also provides employees
     the opportunity to get more sleep, which leads to better brain function and improved performance
     upon their return.

     Foundations have a couple of options with respect to developing a vacation policy: pay vacation pay,
     or provide vacation time. Below are policy statements reflecting both options. Foundations need to
     determine costs and benefits for each as they relate to their circumstances.

Policy and Procedure Statement (paying vacation pay)
All employees at the Foundation will earn vacation pay on all wages earned from the first day of employment.

After being employed for twelve months, an employee will receive an annual vacation. After completing twelve
months of employment, an employee will have earned ten working days of annual vacation.. This means that
starting in the second year, an employee must take the vacation earned in the year before.

Employees shall be required to submit a completed “Leave Form” for vacation time.

No vacation pay/time will be given in advance.

Vacation will be granted on a combination of seniority, availability, and job coverage.

                                                                                                         Policies and Procedures Template - Page 21 Although every effort is made by the Foundation to satisfy an employee’s choice of vacation time, legislation
confirms the Foundation is able to request an employee to take time vacation when the Foundation so chooses.

Full-time Employees – The Foundation will provide vacation pay to employees. The Foundation will pay vacation at
four percent for the first 4 years inclusive and this then becomes 6% to full-time employees in their fifth year. When
vacation time is taken the accrued vacation dollars will be paid to the employee.

It is understood all employees are required to take a minimum two (2) weeks of vacation time each per year. Each
employee will take scheduled vacation time off per the following:

           ●    After completing one full year of service                        ten working days

           ●    Five to ten years continuous service                             fifteen working days

           ●    More than ten years of service                                   twenty working days

Policy and Procedure Statement (earning vacation days)
Full-time Employees – The Foundation pays vacation time to full-time employees. Vacation should be taken in full
during the employment year.

The procedure for a written offer of employment in community foundations in Canada includes the following steps:

1. **Preparation of Written Offer**: After a verbal offer has been made and accepted, a written offer of employment is prepared. This document includes:
   - Position Title
   - Job Description
   - Salary & Benefits
   - Vacation Entitlement
   - Starting Date
   - Hours of Work
   - Probationary Period
   - Statement regarding upholding the foundation's bylaws
   - Any specific conditions that may apply

2. **Copies of the Offer**: Two copies of the offer are made. The potential employee signs one copy and retains the other for their records.

3. **Response to Unsuccessful Applicants**: Upon receiving written acceptance from the applicant, the Foundation will respond in writing to all unsuccessful applicants who were interviewed.

4. **Employment Package**: The employment package will include the Human Resources Policy and Procedure Handbook, Code of Ethics, Confidentiality policies, travel expense claim, and overtime tracking document. The employee must sign a confirmation that they have read and understood the package.

This structured approach ensures clarity and serves as a reference point for any negotiations regarding the employment terms.","The vacation schedule for full-time employees in community foundations in Canada is as follows:

- After completing one full year of service: 10 working days (2 weeks)
- After 5 to 10 years of continuous service: 15 working days (3 weeks)
- More than 10 years of service: 20 working days (4 weeks)

Employees are required to take their vacation in full during the employment year, and cash payments will not be made in lieu of vacation except upon termination of employment.",HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_21 and HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_19 and HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_12 and HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_20,2024-09-16 17:38:22
human_resources_documents,what is policy of cell phone usage  in community foundationas of canada,"J.  It is the responsibility of the ED/CEO to monitor personal usage of any computer. It follows that
               computer use is not private, and may be reviewed by authorized individuals, including the ED/CEO.

           K.  Employees will sign a consent form indicating their understanding of the Foundation’s policy. They
               must understand that violation of the policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including
               dismissal.

                                                                                                          Policies and Procedures Template - Page 17 Cell Phone Usage
Policy and Procedure Statement

      The purpose of this policy is to outline the appropriate use of personal cell phones during the course
      of Foundation business. There is reference to provincial legislation. Foundations need to edit the text
      to refer to restrictions in their respective legislation. The text below was written for a Foundation in
      Alberta, and based on your location, this may need adjustments. As you’re crafting the policy, answer
      the following question for each paragraph: Does this align with our culture and practices, and if not,
      what changes do we need to make?

This policy applies to all Foundation personnel and applies to any device that makes or receives phone calls,
leaves messages, sends text messages, surfs the Internet, or downloads and allows for the reading of and
responding to email whether the device is Foundation-supplied or personally owned.

In compliance with (insert reference to your provincial Highway Traffic Act) the Foundation prohibits its employees
from the following activities for business purposes related in any way to the organization, while driving.

           ●     the use of hand-held cell phones, texting or e-mailing, using electronic devices like laptop computers,
                 video games, cameras, video entertainment displays and programming portable audio players (e.g.:
                 MP3 players), entering information on GPS units, reading printed materials in the vehicle, writing,
                 printing or sketching, and, personal grooming (ensure that this text aligns with provincial regulations)

This prohibition of cell phone or similar device use while driving includes receiving or placing calls, text messaging,
surfing the Internet, receiving or responding to email, checking for phone messages, or any other purpose related
to one’s employment; the business; customers; vendors; volunteer activities, meetings, or civic responsibilities
performed for or attended in the name of the Foundation; or any other Foundation related activities not named
here while driving.

It is recognized that other distractions occur during driving, however the use of cell phones, while driving, is strictly
prohibited by the Foundation. Therefore, employees are required to stop their vehicle in a safe location so that they
can safely use a cell phone or similar device.

The Foundation is aware that employees utilize their personal cellular phones for business purposes. At the same
time, cell phones are a distraction in the workplace. To ensure the effectiveness of meetings, and as a professional
courtesy to others, employees are asked to leave cell phones at their desk. Or, on the unusual occasion of an
emergency or anticipated emergency that requires immediate attention, the cell phone may be carried to the
meeting on vibrate mode.

                                                                                                            Policies and Procedures Template - Page 18 Insurance for Employee or Volunteer Use of Own Auto

      Most foundations are not in a position to own or lease vehicles, which means employees are using
      their own vehicles for foundation business. The purpose of this policy is to outline the employee’s and
      the Foundation’s insurance coverage when an employee uses their own vehicle for Foundation
      business. In this instance the Foundation’s insurance coverage must include non-owned auto. The
      policy also applies to volunteers using their automobile on Foundation business. The Foundation’s
      non-owned auto coverage limit needs to be substituted for the limits in the policy below. The
      Foundation also needs to get confirmation from their employee or volunteer that they are suitably
      insured.

Policy and Procedure Statement
When an employee or volunteer is using a personal vehicle while on Foundation business, their personal auto
insurance is the primary insurer. The Foundation’s limit for non-owned automobiles is $2 million. This is paid in
excess of the underlying automobile insurance for the owner of said vehicle.

For example, if the employee has an underlying liability limit of $1 million (as is typical) and uses a personal vehicle
for Foundation purposes and a claim is substantiated in the amount of $2.5 million, the owner’s automobile policy
would pick up the first $1 million and the Foundation’s insurance would pick up the additional $1.5 million.

Contact with media

      Media relations are important for the Foundation as this gets your name out in the public
      consciousness and informs the community of your Foundation’s impact, your programs, mission, and
      identity. Having a media relations policy helps to mitigate reputational risk.

No information on the internet should be distributed, viewed, copied or saved which is not related to Foundation
business or not in compliance with policies or applicable legislation.

Personal long-distance direct telephone calls from any Foundation telephone are not permitted, except in the
instance of a family emergency. Personal telephone charges will be charged back to the employee upon receipt of
the Foundation’s billing.

  Description- Achievements, Special qualities, area of Improvement.

FOR EXAMPLE:
         Ex #1 If the organization’s vision is to have a turnover via admissions of X Crores, the
                 admission Leader’s biggest chunk of goal would be X. The same being the top-most
                 “Goal” can have a weightage of 50 percentage or thereabout. Now this goal directly
                 impacts the financial and business perspective of the Balance Score Card. This goal
                 will get further divided into achievable for each team member in the admission team.
         Ex #2 In HR Team, the person contributing in resourcing should have the largest chunk of
                 Goals in terms of positions closed within the TAT of 30 days from the raising of
                 requisition. This would directly impact (internal) customer, and business perspective
                 of Balance Score Card. Hence this would be approximately 50 percent weightage of
                 year’s target.
         Ex # 3 In Academics, a direct goal is number of man hours of sessions taken by the faculty.
                 It would also include the efficiency and effectiveness, in terms of bandwidth (breadth
                 and depth), relevance, method of delivery, and feedback of the students.

5.4.8    ASSESSMENT OF GOALS ACHIEVED & ITS’ ALIGNMENT

         1) The assessment of each goal is based on the weightage given to it.
         2) This assessment is first to be done by the Appraisee; what s/he has actually achieved,
             should be noted for each goal.
         3) The Appraiser and Reviewer may then review the assessment of the appraisee, and
             revise the scores given by him/her, if required.
         4) Please note that a goal should not have a weightage of more than 50 percent and should
             not be less than 10 percent. An ideal goal sheet should have 4-6 goals for the Annual
             Appraisal.

     2.1.2.4.     An individual will not be recruited into a department or a position which involves
                  direct supervision or reporting to a relative. The intent is to prevent members of the

             individual will not be recruited into a department or position which involves direct
             supervision or reporting to a relative. The intent is to prevent members of the same
             family from occupying positions where a family relationship may cause undue
             influence, or conflict of interest situations which would affect the wellbeing of the
             Institute.
2.1.14.4. If an employee involved in the recruitment process has a close personal relationship
             with an applicant, the employee must declare this as soon as s/he is aware of the

The policy should emphasize that if a
complaint is received it will be thoroughly investigated.

Discipline
The disciplinary policy should state that employees have the right to know what is expected of
them and what could happen if they infringe the organization’s rules. It would also make the
point that, in handling disciplinary cases, the organization will treat employees in accordance
with the principles of natural justice. It should be supported by a disciplinary procedure (see
Chapter 61).

Diversity management
A policy on managing diversity recognizes that there are differences among employees and
that these differences, if properly managed, will enable work to be done more efficiently and
effectively. It does not focus exclusively on issues of discrimination but instead concentrates on
recognizing the differences between people. As Kandola and Fullerton (1994) express it, the
concept of managing diversity ‘is founded on the premise that harnessing these differences will
create a productive environment in which everyone will feel valued, where their talents are
fully utilized, and in which organizational goals are met’.
Managing diversity is a concept that recognizes the benefits to be gained from differences. It
differs from equal opportunity, which aims to legislate against discrimination, assumes that
people should be assimilated into the organization and, often, relies on affirmative action. This
point was emphasized by Mulholland et al (2005) as follows:

     The new diversity management thinking suggests that diversity management goes
     beyond the equal opportunities management considerations as described by the law,
     and promises to make a positive and strategic contribution to the successful operation
     of business. So diversity management is being hailed as a proactive, strategically rele-
     vant and results-focused approach and a welcome departure from the equal opportuni-
     ties approach, which has been defined as reactive, operational and sometimes
     counterproductive.

        ance assessment, pay and learning opportunities;
  •     focus attention on individual differences rather than group differences.

4.2.2. Employee Development and Performance Support
         IHVN is committed to providing employees with the resources and support required to

Defining goals in the performance management cycle of IHVN involves several key steps. It begins with performance planning, where goals and targets are set and agreed upon to align with the Institute’s mission, vision, and business objectives for the upcoming period. Supervisors are responsible for cascading departmental goals to individual goals and key performance indicators, as well as defining behavioral expectations and employee development goals. 

Additionally, the outcomes of previous performance appraisals are considered to inform the goal-setting process, ensuring that individual goals are aligned with departmental objectives and the overall corporate plan. This structured approach aims to promote a culture of high performance and accountability within the organization.","The SMART principles in the performance management cycle of IHVN are as follows:

- **Specific**: Goals should be definite and clearly defined, leaving no ambiguity.
- **Measurable**: Goals must have a discrete unit of measure to determine performance relative to the target.
- **Achievable**: Targets should be practical and attainable, even if they are somewhat challenging.
- **Realistic**: Goals need to be reasonable and within the employee's scope of responsibility.
- **Time-based**: Goals should be delivered within a specified timeframe. 

These principles guide the process of defining goals to ensure they align with the Institute's mission, vision, and business objectives.",IHVN-HR-Policy-Manual-Final-PCL.pdf_41 and IHVN-HR-Policy-Manual-Final-PCL.pdf_6 and IHVN-HR-Policy-Manual-Final-PCL.pdf_62 and IHVN-HR-Policy-Manual-Final-PCL.pdf_44,2024-09-18 11:53:48

 5.3.7.1. Introduction

 5.3.7.1.1.

Monitoring progress during the Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) period at IHVN involves several key components:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Supervisors are responsible for overseeing employee progress throughout the PIP period, providing ongoing advice, feedback, and recognition of good performance.

2. **Periodic Performance Reviews**: These reviews occur every three months and assess employee progress against key performance goals. They help identify any performance gaps or challenges early on, allowing for timely feedback and necessary adjustments.

3. **Documentation**: A written report is prepared after each performance review to document the findings and outcomes.

4. **Consequences of Performance Levels**: If an employee's performance remains below the required standard at the end of a review, a warning letter is issued. Conversely, if performance improves to an acceptable level, the employee is taken off the PIP.

Overall, the monitoring process is designed to support employee development and ensure alignment with the Institute's objectives.","The housing allowance at IHVN is paid monthly until the confirmation of appointment. After confirmation, the remaining balance is paid up-front. If an employee who received the up-front payment separates from the Institute before the end of the period covered by the housing allowance, they will be required to refund the outstanding amount.",IHVN-HR-Policy-Manual-Final-PCL.pdf_40 and IHVN-HR-Policy-Manual-Final-PCL.pdf_19 and IHVN-HR-Policy-Manual-Final-PCL.pdf_124 and IHVN-HR-Policy-Manual-Final-PCL.pdf_55,2024-09-18 12:00:02

Physical & Sexual Harassment: These include practical jokes, pushing, shoving, aggressive behavior and the like.
Acts of sexual harassment include any unwanted physical contact, unnecessary touching, or physical interference
with work or movement.

Visual Harassment: These include obscene gestures, demeaning posters, cartoons, graffiti or drawings which are
shown to an individual or group or displayed in plain view. Where these have a sexual orientation, this will
constitute sexual harassment.

                                                                                                          Policies and Procedures Template - Page 39 Procedure:
Where, in the opinion of the employee, volunteer or contractor unfair treatment has been rendered or a problem
arises, the following procedure shall be followed.

           1.    If possible, immediately tell the person whom you feel is harassing you that their conduct or behaviour
                 is unwelcome and that you wish it to be stopped.

           2.    Make some notes about what happened (what was said or done), when it happened (date, time and
                 place), who was involved and who may have witnessed the incident. You will want these details to
                 refresh your memory and in case the problem is not corrected and you have to take the matter further.

           3.    If the harassing behaviour continues, or if you feel unable to approach the harasser directly about this
                 problem, report the incident to the appropriate supervisor within seven (7) days of the incident. If the
                 supervisor is the cause of the problem the situation should be discussed with the ED/CEO. If the
                 ED/CEO is the cause of the problem the situation should be discussed with the Board Chair. The
                 employee, volunteer or contractor has the choice of either discussing the problem (in the case of an
                 informal concern) or submitting a formal or written concern.

           4.    In cases where the concern can be corrected in an informal manner, the supervisor (or Chair of the
                 Board) may discuss the situation with everyone involved, develop an action plan, and check with the
                 employee periodically to ensure the problem is being resolved.

           5.    In cases where the concern has been put in writing a full investigation will be carried out, every effort
                 will be made to resolve the problem to the employee’s satisfaction.

           6.    If the supervisor has been unable to resolve the situation within (10) working days, the supervisor shall
                 take the matter to the ED/CEO.

The objective of the exit interviews is to understand
              the reasons for employee turnover, highlight trends requiring attention and take
              appropriate measures to address employee issues and facilitate employee retention.

         •    A representative from HR will coordinate and meet with the departing staff members to
              conduct the exit interview one to two weeks before the last working day. HR will record
              the employee’s responses on the Exit Interview Form. In case a face-to-face exit interview
              is not possible due to distance or short notice, HR will send the form to the departing
              employee and ask him/her to complete it and submit to HR.

We initially started with 363,003 bail documents across all the 71 dis- tricts of U.P., and after removing documents hav- ing segmentation errors, we have a Bail corpus with 176,849 bail documents. The bail corpus has a total of 2,342,073 unique tokens, and on average, each document has 614 tokens. A sample docu- ment segmented into various sections is shown in Appendix I. 4 HLDC: Ethical Aspects We create HLDC to promote research and au- tomation in the legal domain dealing with under- researched and low-resource languages like Hindi. The documents that are part of HLDC are in the public domain and hence accessible to all. Given the volume of pending cases in the lower courts, our efforts are aimed towards improving the legal system, which in turn would be beneficial for mil- lions of people. Our work is in line with some of the previous work on legal NLP, e.g., legal cor- pora creation and legal judgement prediction (sec- tion 2). Nevertheless, we are aware that if not handled correctly, legal AI systems developed on legal corpora can negatively impact an individual and society at large. Consequently, we took all possible steps to remove any personal information and biases in the corpus.

Bail docu- ments were structured into different sections. We extracted these sections from the bail documents. Details are mentioned below. An example of doc- ument with different sections is shown in Table 10. D.1 Header Header refers to the meta data related to the case, for example, 9TXT (IPC (Indian Penal Code) sec- tions), JTAT (police station), case number, date of hearing, accused name, etc. Header is present at the top of the document. Header mostly ended with 7T (IPC) or JTAT (police station) details. Hence, in order to cut the document to get header, we first find the indices of &T¥T (IPC) and 414 (police station), and from these indices we find the finishing word of the header. We then segment the document at the finishing word. We also include the first line of upcoming paragraph in header as it also didn’t contain case arguments but contained data like if this is the first bail application or not. D.2 Case Result Case Result refers to the end of the document where judge writes their decision. Judge either ac- cepts the bail application or rejects it. If the judge had accepted the bail document then this section mostly also contains bail amount and bail terms for accused. We observed that result section mostly began along the following line, ATHET & HHET Tt T TERT (looking at all facts of the case), the keyword T4 (facts) was very common around the start of the result section. Hence, we iterated over the indices of keyword T (facts) in reverse order and checked if the division at that index is correct. To check if the division is correct we look for bail result in lower half of the division, if the bail result is present, we classify that division as correct else we move to next index of T¥4T (facts). D.3 Body The remaining portion of the document after re- moving header and result section was called body. Body section was further divided, as described be- low. D.3.1 Most of the bail documents have a concluding paragraph where the judge summarizes their view- points of the case. this, we first constructed certain regex which often precedes judge’s summary, defendant’s and prosecutor’s ar- guments (described in Table 5).

Nevertheless, we are aware that if not handled correctly, legal AI systems developed on legal corpora can negatively impact an individual and society at large. Consequently, we took all possible steps to remove any personal information and biases in the corpus. We anonymized the cor- pus (section 3) with respect to names, gender in- formation, titles, locations, times, judge’s name, petitioners and appellant’s name. As observed in previous work (Malik et al., 2021), anonymization of a judge’s name is important as there is a corre- lation between a case outcome and a judge name. Along with the HLDC, we also introduce the task of Bail Prediction. Bail applications constitute the bulk of the cases (§3), augmentation by an AI sys- tem can help in this case. The bail prediction task aims not to promote the development of systems that replace humans but rather the development of systems that augment humans. The bail prediction task provides only the facts of the case to predict the final decision and avoids any biases that may affect the final decision. Moreover, the Bail cor- pus and corresponding bail prediction systems can promote the development of explainable systems (Malik et al., 2021), we leave research on such ex- plainable systems for future work.

For- mally, consider a corpus of bail documents D = b1, b2, · · · , bi, where each bail document is seg- mented as bi = (hi, fi, ji, yi).

The Hindi Legal Document Corpus (HLDC) can be used for a number of legal appli- cations, and in this paper, we propose the task of Bail Prediction. Given a legal document with facts of the case, the task of bail prediction requires an automated system to predict if the accused should be granted bail or not. We develop baseline mod- els for addressing the task of bail prediction. The motivation behind the task is not to replace a hu- man judge but rather augment them in the judi- cial process.

However, as outlined earlier (§1), the legal do- main comes with its own challenges, viz. spe- cialized legal lexicon, long documents, unstruc- tured and noisy texts. Moreover, our corpus is from an under-resourced language (Hindi). Never- theless, we experimented with existing fine-tuned (pre-trained) models and finally propose a multi- task model for the bail prediction task. 6.1 Embedding Based Models We embedding based model Doc2Vec (Le and Mikolov, 2014) and transformer-based contextualized embed- dings model IndicBERT (Kakwani et al., 2020). Doc2Vec embeddings, is trained on the train set of our corpus. The embeddings go as input to SVM and XgBoost classifiers. language model IndicBERT is a transformer trained on 12 major Indian languages. However, IndicBERT, akin to other transformer LMs, has a limitation on the input’s length (number of tokens). Inspired by Malik et al. (2021); Chalkidis et al. (2019), we experimented with fine-tuning IndicBERT in two settings: the first 512 tokens and the last 512 tokens of the document. The fine-tuned transformer with a classification head is used for bail prediction.

For- mally, consider a corpus of bail documents D = b1, b2, · · · , bi, where each bail document is seg- mented as bi = (hi, fi, ji, yi). Here, hi, fi, ji and yi represent the header, facts, judge’s summary and bail decision of the document respectively. Additionally, the facts of every document contain k sentences, more formally, fi = (s1 i ), where sk i represents the kth sentence of the ith bail document. We formulate the bail prediction task as a binary classification problem. We are inter- ested in modelling pθ(yi|fi), which is the proba- bility of the outcome yi given the facts of a case fi. Here, yi ∈ 0, 1, i.e., 0 if bail is denied or 1 if bail is granted. 6 Bail Prediction Models We initially experimented with off-the-shelf pre- trained models trained on general-purpose texts.

Bail prediction models are automated systems designed to predict whether bail should be granted or denied based on the facts of a legal case. This task is formulated as a binary classification problem, where the outcome is represented as 0 (bail denied) or 1 (bail granted). The models utilize a corpus of bail documents, which are segmented into components such as the header, facts, judge's summary, and bail decision. The aim is to augment human judges by providing an initial analysis of cases, thereby expediting the judicial process. Various deep learning models, including multi-task learning based on transformer architecture, are experimented with for this task.","Embedding-based models refer to techniques that convert text data into numerical representations (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning. In the context provided, two specific embedding-based models are mentioned: Doc2Vec and IndicBERT.

Figure 3 shows the map of U.P. and district wise variation in the number of cases. As can be seen in the plot, the western side of the state has more cases; this is possibly due to the high population and more ur- banization in the western part. Table 1 shows %- wise division of different case types in HLDC. As evident from the table, majority of documents per- tain to bail applications. HLDC corpus has a total of 3,797,817 unique tokens, and on average, each document has 764 tokens. HLDC Creation Pipeline: We outline the entire pipeline used to create the corpus in Figure 1. The documents on the website are originally typed in Hindi (in Devanagari script) and then scanned to PDF format and uploaded. The first step in HLDC creation is the scraping of documents from the e- Courts website. We crawled a total of 1,221,950 documents. To extract Hindi text from these, we perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) via the Tesseract tool2. Tesseract worked well for our use case as the majority of case documents were well-typed, and it outperformed other OCR libraries3. The obtained text documents were fur- ther cleaned to remove noisy documents, e.g. too short (< 32 bytes) or too long (> 8096 bytes) doc- uments, duplicates, and English documents (de- 2https://github.com/tesseract-ocr 3https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR tails in Appendix B). This resulted in a total of 912,568 documents in HLDC. We anonymized the corpus with respect to names and locations. We used a gazetteer* along with regex-based rules for NER to anonymize the data. List of first names, last names, middle names, locations, titles like gfed (Pandit: title of Priest), AT (Sir: Sir), month names and day names were normalized to <ATH> (Naam: <name>).

legal_documents,What is bail corpus creation pipeline,"Our work is in line with some of the previous work on legal NLP, e.g., legal cor- pora creation and legal judgement prediction (sec- tion 2). Nevertheless, we are aware that if not handled correctly, legal AI systems developed on legal corpora can negatively impact an individual and society at large. Consequently, we took all possible steps to remove any personal information and biases in the corpus. We anonymized the cor- pus (section 3) with respect to names, gender in- formation, titles, locations, times, judge’s name, petitioners and appellant’s name. As observed in previous work (Malik et al., 2021), anonymization of a judge’s name is important as there is a corre- lation between a case outcome and a judge name. Along with the HLDC, we also introduce the task of Bail Prediction. Bail applications constitute the bulk of the cases (§3), augmentation by an AI sys- tem can help in this case. The bail prediction task aims not to promote the development of systems that replace humans but rather the development of systems that augment humans. The bail prediction task provides only the facts of the case to predict the final decision and avoids any biases that may affect the final decision. Moreover, the Bail cor- pus and corresponding bail prediction systems can promote the development of explainable systems (Malik et al., 2021), we leave research on such ex- plainable systems for future work. The legal do- main is a relatively new area in NLP research, and more research and investigations are required in this area, especially concerning biases and soci- etal impacts; for this to happen, there is a need for corpora, and in this paper, we make initial steps towards these goals. 5 Bail Prediction Task To demonstrate a possible applicability for HLDC, we propose the Bail Prediction Task, where given is to predict the facts of the case, whether the bail would be granted or denied.

Additionally, there is lexical diversity present across documents from different districts.

1 Introduction In recent times, the legal system in many populous countries (e.g., India) has been inundated with a large number of legal documents and pending cases (Katju, 2019). There is an imminent need for automated systems to process legal documents and help augment the legal procedures. For example, if a system could readily extract the required in- formation from a legal document for a legal prac- titioner, then it would help them expedite the legal process. However, the processing of legal docu- ments is challenging and is quite different from conventional text processing tasks. For example, legal documents are typically quite long (tens of pages), legal documents are highly unstructured and noisy (spelling and grammar mistakes, since these are typed), language in legal documents are domain-specific, and pre-trained language models do not perform well on these (Malik et al., 2021). To develop legal text processing systems and ad- dress the challenges associated with the legal do- main, there is a need for creating specialized le- gal domain corpora. In recent times, there have been efforts to develop such corpora for exam- ple, Chalkidis et al. (2019) have developed an En- glish corpus of European Court of Justice docu- ments, Malik et al. (2021) have developed an En- glish corpus of Indian Supreme Court documents, Xiao et al. (2018) have developed Chinese Legal Document corpus. However, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any legal docu- ment corpus for the Hindi language (a language belonging to the Indo-European family and pre- dominantly spoken in India). Hindi uses Devana- gri (Wikipedia contributors, 2021) script for the writing system. Hindi is spoken by approx. 567 million people in the world (WorldData, 2021). Most of the lower (district) courts in Northern In- dia use Hindi as the official language. However, most of the legal NLP systems that currently exist in India have been developed on English, and these do not work on Hindi legal documents (Malik et al., 2021).","The special components of legal documents often include:

- Caption (for anything submitted to the court)
- Heading (for most legal documents, including letters)
- Place for signatures, especially for instruments
- Acknowledgment/space for the document to be notarized, where appropriate
- Space for the attorney to sign in filings with the court

These components are essential for the proper formatting and legal validity of the documents.",Slides_01.pdf_35 and Slides_01.pdf_34 and Slides_01.pdf_2,2024-09-18 15:18:23

Bail Decision Extraction: Decision was ex- tracted from Case Result Section using a rule based approach (Details in Appendix E). Bail Amount Extraction: If bail was granted, it usually has some bail amount associated with it. We extracted this bail amount using regex patterns (Details in Appendix F). We verified each step of the corpus creation pipeline (Detailed analysis in Appendix G) to en- sure the quality of the data. We initially started with 363,003 bail documents across all the 71 dis- tricts of U.P., and after removing documents hav- ing segmentation errors, we have a Bail corpus with 176,849 bail documents. The bail corpus has a total of 2,342,073 unique tokens, and on average, each document has 614 tokens. A sample docu- ment segmented into various sections is shown in Appendix I. 4 HLDC: Ethical Aspects We create HLDC to promote research and au- tomation in the legal domain dealing with under- researched and low-resource languages like Hindi. The documents that are part of HLDC are in the public domain and hence accessible to all. Given the volume of pending cases in the lower courts, our efforts are aimed towards improving the legal system, which in turn would be beneficial for mil- lions of people. Our work is in line with some of the previous work on legal NLP, e.g., legal cor- pora creation and legal judgement prediction (sec- tion 2). Nevertheless, we are aware that if not handled correctly, legal AI systems developed on legal corpora can negatively impact an individual and society at large. Consequently, we took all possible steps to remove any personal information and biases in the corpus.

The special components of legal documents often include:

- Caption (for anything submitted to the court)
- Heading (for most legal documents, including letters)
- Place for signatures, especially for instruments
- Acknowledgment/space for the document to be notarized, where appropriate
- Space for the attorney to sign in filings with the court

These components are essential for the proper formatting and legal validity of the documents.","Some physical aspects of legal documents include:

- **Paper**: Generally, letter size is used, but legal size may be required for certain instruments like deeds.
- **Typeface**: A conservative, traditional font should be used.
- **Margins**: Margins should be large enough for comfortable reading, typically 1.5 inches.
- **Spacing**: Pleadings and some instruments should be double spaced, while most other documents can be 1.5 spaced; letters are often single spaced.

Additionally, legal documents often contain special components such as:

- Caption (for anything submitted to the court)
- Heading (for most legal documents, including letters)
- Place for signatures, especially for instruments
- Acknowledgment/space for notarization, where appropriate
- Space for the attorney's signature in court filings.",Slides_01.pdf_35 and Slides_01.pdf_34 and Slides_01.pdf_12,2024-09-18 15:19:10

Inherent      limitations      of   internal     financial     controls
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial
controls      with     reference       to    Standalone        Financial
Statements,       including     the   possibility    of   collusion     or
improper      management         override     of   controls,    material
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal
financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial
Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that
the internal financial control with reference to Standalone
Financial Statements may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Technology – Computer Use, Business Phones, Internet and Email

      An effective Technology Use Policy places the responsibility for data security into the hands of the
      user. Ultimately, a well-defined policy sets the precedence for what your organization is responsible for
      versus what the users are responsible for regarding security. Use the template below as the basis for
      your Foundation’s policy and amend accordingly.

Use of technology is not only driving
cost optimisation but is also making our
networks more sustainable. We are making
our network and data centres greener. Over
the years, we have stepped up our efforts
on network site greening. As a consequence
58% of total sites are now defined as green
compared to 43% last year. Additionally,
we deployed solar access on more than
15,000 sites in FY2023-24, highest in any
given year.
We have taken significant steps at each
level of the business towards environment-
friendly procurement: SIM cards are
made from recycled plastic material,
DTH boxes now come with compostable
packaging material.
Airtel’s workforce transformation has
been remarkable, increasing women
representation from 11% to 15.8%, driven
by gender-balanced hiring, adaptable
work formats, a robust infrastructure and
policy framework that fosters a culture
of inclusion. Throughout the year, the
organisation made notable strides in
enhancing gender diversity, all of Airtel’s
stores are now gender balanced.
We take pride in our disclosures,
transparency and code of ethics, and have
been commended on governance excellence
by reputed global and national institutions.

Our legacy of deep commitment to compassion and care for
patients resonates throughout the organisation. Our vision
of providing high quality, life-saving drugs at affordable
prices since our inception, has evolved into our endearing
purpose, ‘Caring for Life’. This purpose ultimately guides our
organisational decisions and anchors our every action.

Creating Value

At Cipla, we aim to abide by the highest standards of good
governance and ethical behaviour across all levels within
the organisation with a zero-tolerance policy towards any
deviation     from    these   standards.      Our   ethical    framework
focuses on long-term shareholder value creation through
responsible decision-making. Cipla’s corporate governance
framework is founded on the following pillars:
Transparency

For    us,  transparency       is  key    to  healthy,    self-sustaining
growth and promotes self-enforcing checks and balances.
It also fosters deep and long-standing trust among our
stakeholders. We strive to demonstrate the highest levels
of transparency, over and above statutory requirements,
through accurate and prompt disclosures.
Fairness
We practice fair play and integrity in our transactions with
all stakeholders, both within and outside the organisation.
We conduct ourselves in the most equitable manner.
Accountability
For   us,   accountability     is  about    holding     ourselves    firmly
responsible for what we believe in and for delivering what
we have promised. We ensure this by promoting a mind-set
of end-to-end ownership throughout the organisation. By
means of openness and transparency, we consider ourselves
accountable to the entire universe of stakeholders including
our patients, employees, shareholders, vendors, government
agencies,      society,    medical     community,       customers      and
business partners and supply chain participants.
Competent leadership and management

We believe that a dynamic, diverse and experienced Board with
a focus on excellence plays a pivotal role in Cipla’s corporate
governance aspirations. In view of this, we endeavour to
maintain a Board composition that brings healthy balance of
skills, experience, independence, assurance, growth mind-set
and deep knowledge of the sector.
Empowerment

The empowerment of leaders and employees is an important
step     in  enabling      high    performance        and     developing

leadership capabilities within the Company.

The key audit matters for Cipla Ltd. include DPCO matters, which involve various notices of demand from the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) regarding alleged overcharging for certain drugs. The total demand amounts to Rs. 3,707 crores. The audit addressed these matters by understanding management's processes, evaluating key controls, and inspecting correspondence with external legal counsel to corroborate the understanding of these issues.",This question is outside the provided context.,Cipla.pdf_671 and Cipla.pdf_758 and Cipla.pdf_883 and Cipla.pdf_391,2024-09-20 12:24:10

       capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of
       this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be
       used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
      Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified
       as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of
      time is required, as per contractual terms.

      Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.

      The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress
       payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.

      In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the
       obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.

      Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group reviews
       modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new
       performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is
       revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.

      The Group disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.

      Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:

B.    Leased Assets (Right-of-Use Assets)
      The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for Land, Buildings, Plant and Equipment and Vehicles.
      The Company assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at the inception of a contract. A contract is, or
      contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in
      exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset,
      the Company assesses whether:

      (i)    the contract involves the use of an identified asset
      (ii)   the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the
             lease and

      (iii)  the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
      The right-of-use asset is a lessee’s right to use an asset over the life of a lease. At the date of commencement of
      the lease, the Company recognises a right-of-use asset (‘ROU’) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease
      arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases of low value assets. For these leases of low value assets, the
      Company recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Creating Value

At Cipla, we aim to abide by the highest standards of good
governance and ethical behaviour across all levels within
the organisation with a zero-tolerance policy towards any
deviation     from    these   standards.      Our   ethical    framework
focuses on long-term shareholder value creation through
responsible decision-making. Cipla’s corporate governance
framework is founded on the following pillars:
Transparency

For    us,  transparency       is  key    to  healthy,    self-sustaining
growth and promotes self-enforcing checks and balances.
It also fosters deep and long-standing trust among our
stakeholders. We strive to demonstrate the highest levels
of transparency, over and above statutory requirements,
through accurate and prompt disclosures.
Fairness
We practice fair play and integrity in our transactions with
all stakeholders, both within and outside the organisation.
We conduct ourselves in the most equitable manner.
Accountability
For   us,   accountability     is  about    holding     ourselves    firmly
responsible for what we believe in and for delivering what
we have promised. We ensure this by promoting a mind-set

Hindalco Industries Ltd. engages in domestic bauxite operations as part of its integrated business model, which includes bauxite mining and the production of aluminium and value-added products. The company operates several mines, including bauxite and coal, and emphasizes sustainability, such as 100% bauxite residue utilization across its refineries.","The significance of the rising demand for aluminum and copper products includes several key points:

1. **Projected Growth**: By 2033, aluminum demand in India is expected to double from 4.5 million MT to 9 million MT, while copper consumption is set to increase from 1 million MT to 2 million MT.

2. **Business Opportunities**: The increase in demand will open potential opportunities across diverse sectors such as automotive and transport, urban infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, and packaging.

3. **Technological Innovations**: There is a focus on developing newer products and solutions, enhancing downstream capacity for various applications, and capital allocation for expansion and product development.

4. **Recycling and Circular Economy**: Both aluminum and copper have high recycling properties, which can support the circular economy. The volume of post-consumer aluminum and copper is expected to rise with increased consumption, and using recycled metals can help meet consumer demands while reducing the need for virgin metals.

5. **Infrastructure Development**: The growing urban population is projected to drive demand for infrastructure development, which will further increase the consumption of aluminum and copper.

6. **Electric Mobility**: The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) is driving a rise in copper usage, as EVs require significantly more copper than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

Overall, the rising demand for aluminum and copper products is significant for economic growth, sustainability, and technological advancement across various industries.",Hindalco.pdf_107 and Hindalco.pdf_90 and Hindalco.pdf_108,2024-09-20 15:21:12

The significance of the rising demand for aluminum and copper products includes several key points:

1. **Projected Growth**: By 2033, aluminum demand in India is expected to double from 4.5 million MT to 9 million MT, while copper consumption is set to increase from 1 million MT to 2 million MT.

2. **Business Opportunities**: The increase in demand will open potential opportunities across diverse sectors such as automotive and transport, urban infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, and packaging.

3. **Technological Innovations**: There is a focus on developing newer products and solutions, enhancing downstream capacity for various applications, and capital allocation for expansion and product development.

4. **Recycling and Circular Economy**: Both aluminum and copper have high recycling properties, which can support the circular economy. The volume of post-consumer aluminum and copper is expected to rise with increased consumption, and using recycled metals can help meet consumer demands while reducing the need for virgin metals.

5. **Infrastructure Development**: The growing urban population is projected to drive demand for infrastructure development, which will further increase the consumption of aluminum and copper.

6. **Electric Mobility**: The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) is driving a rise in copper usage, as EVs require significantly more copper than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

Overall, the rising demand for aluminum and copper products is significant for economic growth, sustainability, and technological advancement across various industries.","Hindalco's consolidated revenue for FY 2023-24 was ₹2,15,962 crore, which is a 3% decrease compared to ₹2,23,202 crore in FY 2022-23.",Hindalco.pdf_502 and Hindalco.pdf_510 and Hindalco.pdf_496,2024-09-20 15:33:56

A     Management of Liquidity Risk
      Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The
      Group’s approach in managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due
      without incurring unacceptable losses. In doing this, management considers both normal and stressed conditions.

      The Group maintained a cautious liquidity strategy, with a positive cash balance throughout the year ended 31st
      March, 2024 and 31st March, 2023. Cash flow from operating activities provides the funds to service the financial
      liabilities on a day-to-day basis.

      The Group regularly monitors the rolling forecasts to ensure it has sufficient cash on an on-going basis to meet
      operational needs. Any short-term surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required for working
      capital management and other operational requirements, is retained as cash and cash equivalents (to the extent
      required) and any excess is invested in interest bearing term deposits and other highly marketable debt investments
      with appropriate maturities to optimise the cash returns on investments while ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet
      its liabilities.
      The following table shows the maturity analysis of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities based on
      contractually agreed undiscounted cash flows along with its carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.

Qualitative disclosure on LCR
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking sector.
The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks. It does this by ensuring
that banks have an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted easily and
immediately into cash to meet their liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The LCR is expected to
improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source,
thus reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy.

The Liquidity Risk Management of the Bank is governed by the Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy approved by the
Board. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision-making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest
rate risk management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk
tolerance / limits set by the Board. The Bank has also set up a senior level management committee, viz., the Group Risk
Management Committee (GRMC) under the ICAAP framework of the Bank, to establish a formal and dedicated structure
to periodically assess the nature / quantum of material risks of the subsidiaries and adequacy of its risk management
processes, including providing oversight for managing liquidity risk. Liquidity for the Bank’s domestic banking operations
is directly managed at the Head Office. The overseas branches and offshore unit of the Bank independently manage their
liquidity requirements with support from the Head Office. Similarly, the Bank’s subsidiaries independently manage their
liquidity requirements under guidance of the GRMC, which, along with senior management of the subsidiaries, reviews
the risk assessment of material risks at the subsidiaries. Further, the Bank maintains suitable systems and processes to
monitor liquidity requirements in other currencies as appropriate.

In order to determine cash outflows, the Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, viz., Retail (which
include deposits from individuals), Small Business Customers (those with deposits upto ` 7.5 crore), and Wholesale (which
would cover all residual deposits).","Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank may not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due without incurring unacceptable losses.

generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners
located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on
imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to
offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions
where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company
to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing
the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the
Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse
impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions
being imposed on the Company’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly
more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international
disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.

Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations
that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power
shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks,
labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control.

An escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China has resulted in trade restrictions,
increased protectionism and increased tariﬀs that harm our ability to participate in Chinese markets or compete eﬀectively with Chinese companies. Sustained
uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners,
especially China, and possible decoupling of the U.S. and China economies, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade.
Such events may also (i) cause our customers and consumers to reduce, delay or forgo technology spending, (ii) result in customers sourcing products from other
suppliers not subject to such restrictions or tariﬀs, (iii) lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and customers, and (iv) intensify pricing pressures.
Any or all of these factors could negatively aﬀect demand for our products and our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
 Our business is subject to various governmental regula ons, and compliance with these regula ons may cause us to incur signiﬁcant expense. If we fail to
maintain compliance with applicable regula ons, we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribu on of certain products, and we could be subject to
administra ve proceedings and civil or criminal penal es.
      Our business is subject to various domestic and international laws and other legal requirements, including anti-competition and import/export regulations,
such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and applicable executive orders. These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and
with limited notice, and have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur signiﬁcant expense to comply with,
or to remedy violations of, these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend sales to these
customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations. The U.S. government may also add companies to its restricted
entity list and/or technologies to its list of prohibited exports to speciﬁc countries, which have had and may continue to have an adverse eﬀect on our ability to
sell our products and our revenue.

In addition, we rely on top-tier banking partners in
key markets around the world, who themselves face economic, societal, political and other risks, for access to credit and to
facilitate collection, payment and supply chain finance programs. A disruption to one or more of these top-tier partners could
impact our ability to draw on existing credit facilities or otherwise adversely affect our cash flows or the cash flows of our
customers and vendors.
Changing political and geopolitical conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results.
Changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, as well as changing
geopolitical conditions, may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. Results of
elections, referendums, sanctions or other political processes and pressures in certain markets in which our products are
manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations
may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, tariffs, import and export controls and the general movement of goods,
materials, services, capital, data and people between countries. The potential implications of such uncertainty, which include,
among others, exchange rate fluctuations, new or increased tariffs, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect
the Company’s results of operations and cash flows.
The Company operates a global business with sales, manufacturing, distribution and research and development organizations
globally that contribute to our overall growth. If geopolitical tensions and trade controls were to increase or disrupt our business
in markets where we have significant sales or operations, including disruptions due to governmental responses to such conflicts
(such as the imposition of sanctions, retaliatory tariffs, increased business licensing requirements or limitations on profits), such
disruptions could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The war between Russia and Ukraine has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and
financial results.
The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted, and the situation it generates may continue to negatively impact,
our operations. Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and
suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to
the high level of uncertainty as to how the overall situation will evolve. Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical
damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities, our distribution centers or those of our customers.","Political tensions between the U.S. and China could significantly affect Apple Inc.'s business operations in several ways. The company has a large global business, with a majority of its sales coming from outside the U.S., and it relies heavily on manufacturing partners located primarily in China. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls, can adversely impact Apple's operations and supply chain, limiting its ability to offer and distribute products.

Increased trade tensions have already led to trade restrictions and tariffs that harm Apple's ability to compete effectively in Chinese markets. If these tensions escalate further, the company may face more severe restrictions, which could disrupt its operations and require costly changes, such as altering suppliers or restructuring business relationships. Additionally, political uncertainty can negatively affect consumer confidence and spending, further impacting Apple's business.

Moreover, sustained trade tensions could lead to a global economic slowdown, causing customers to reduce or delay technology spending, source products from other suppliers, or even lead to the insolvency of key suppliers and customers.

The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known
or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of
operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.

Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should
not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.
This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.
This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.

Macroeconomic and Industry Risks

The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can
materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s
global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the
U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.

Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency
fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In
addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility,
declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.

Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency
fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In
addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility,
declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.

In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions
can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel
partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.

Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties
and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial
instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health
issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.
Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business
interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers,
suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.

                                                                                       Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5 The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it
generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners
located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

        You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our
business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company.

Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the
Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license
such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.

The Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled
employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.
Much of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel,
including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand
and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense
competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially
adversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.

The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could
materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially
adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.
The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute
products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to
consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.

Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the
device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.

                                                                                     Apple Inc.

Adverse macroeconomic conditions can significantly impact Apple Inc.'s business operations and financial stability in several ways. These conditions include slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, all of which can adversely affect consumer confidence and spending. This decline in consumer confidence can lead to reduced demand for Apple’s products and services.

Additionally, adverse economic conditions can create uncertainty for Apple’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, and other partners, potentially leading to financial instability, inability to obtain credit, and even insolvency. This can disrupt Apple’s supply chain and operations.

Furthermore, adverse economic conditions can increase credit and collectibility risks on trade receivables, limit the company's ability to issue new debt, reduce liquidity, and lead to declines in the fair values of financial instruments.

insurance_documents,"Why is the Company's ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace essential?","The Company faces substantial competition in
these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital
content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of
active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have
the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have
from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.

Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or
collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate
the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.

The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established
service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes
with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.

The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and
services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services
that compete effectively.

Business Risks

To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products
and services.
Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new
products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and
services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services.

products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and
services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions
depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with
new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase
commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet
anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will
successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.

The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are
located outside of the U.S.
Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan,
South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often
in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties.
The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce
the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the
quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although
arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the
consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time.

The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.
The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well
as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines,

applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or
collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.

Supply of Components
Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from
single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,
tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times
subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize
custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the
suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,
may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s
requirements.

The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or
renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.

Research and Development
Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully
depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace.

Research and Development
Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully
depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company
continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development
(“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.

Intellectual Property
The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and
services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although
the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in
part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.

The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and
marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and
registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and
services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.

In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third
parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the
Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be
obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.

                                                                                      Apple Inc.

The Company takes several steps to ensure the health and safety of its team members, including:

1. **Identifying Risks**: The Company identifies potential workplace risks to develop measures that mitigate possible hazards.

2. **Training**: It supports employees with general safety, security, and crisis management training, along with specific programs for those in high-hazard environments.

Markets and Distribution
The Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets.

The Company's ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace is essential due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets in which it operates. The Company faces substantial competition from rivals with significant resources, broader product lines, and aggressive pricing strategies. To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must frequently introduce new products and services, enhance existing offerings, and effectively manage transitions to these new and upgraded products. This ongoing innovation is crucial for maintaining functional and design advantages, as well as for successfully managing the risks associated with new technologies and production challenges.","Apple Inc. offers a variety of product lines, which include:

            (1)   As of September 30, 2023, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to purchase up to $90 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share
                  repurchase program announced on May 4, 2023, of which $15.9 billion had been utilized. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also utilized the final
                  $4.6 billion under its previous repurchase program, which was most recently authorized in April 2022.

(together, “Masimo”) filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC”) alleging
infringement by the Company of five patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo
sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality.
On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the “Order”) prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with
blood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the end of the administrative review
period, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to appeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal.

Other Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The
Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial
condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting
period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.

Forward-Looking Statements
The discussions in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and
uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning supply chain constraints, our strategy,
competition, future operations and production capacity, future financial position, future revenues, projected costs, profitability, expected cost reductions,
capital adequacy, expectations regarding demand and acceptance for our technologies, growth opportunities and trends in the markets in which we
operate, prospects and plans and objectives of management. The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,”
“plans,” “projects,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking
statements contain these identifying words. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking
statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans,
intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements that we make. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the risks set forth in Part
I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and that are otherwise described or updated
from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The discussion of such risks is not an indication that any
such risks have occurred at the time of this filing. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Table of Contents

       This   Annual    Report    on   Form    10-K   contains     forward-looking      statements     within   the   meaning     of  the   U.S.

All statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K other than
statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our
objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words ""believe,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""estimate,"" ""continue,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""expect,""
and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current
expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-
term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties
and assumptions, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive
and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact
of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in
any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking
statements.

        We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given
these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward‑looking statements.

        Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms ""Meta,"" ""company,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" and ""our"" in this document refer to Meta
Platforms, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. The term ""Family"" refers to our Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and
WhatsApp products. For references to accessing Meta's products on the ""web"" or via a ""website,"" such terms refer to accessing such products on personal
computers.

The aggregate market value of voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates of Broadcom Inc. as of April 28, 2023, was approximately $253.7 billion, based on the closing sale price of such shares on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on that date.","The sections of the Annual Report on Form 10-K that specifically mention forward-looking statements include the ""NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS"" and the discussions throughout the report that contain such statements, particularly those regarding future results of operations, financial position, business strategy, and objectives for future operations. Additionally, the forward-looking statements are identified by words such as ""believe,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""estimate,"" ""continue,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""expect,"" and similar expressions.",NASDAQ_FB_2023.pdf_4 and NASDAQ_TSLA_2023.pdf_5 and NYSE_V_2023.pdf_20 and NASDAQ_FB_2023.pdf_5,2024-09-20 16:52:36
insurance_documents,: What are the main sources from which Broadcom derives its forward-looking statements?,"Such statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections of our industry performance and macroeconomic conditions, based on
management’s judgment, beliefs, current trends and market conditions, and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to diﬀer materially from
those contained in the forward-looking statements. We derive most of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are
based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very diﬃcult to predict the impact of known
factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could aﬀect our actual results. Accordingly, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these
statements. Material factors that could cause actual results to diﬀer materially from our expectations are summarized and disclosed under “Risk Factors” in Part I,
Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
       Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Broadcom,” “we,” “our,” and “us” mean Broadcom Inc. and its consolidated
subsidiaries. Our ﬁscal year ends on the Sunday closest to October 31 in a 52-week year and the ﬁrst Sunday in November in a 53-week year. We refer to our
ﬁscal years by the calendar year in which they end. For example, the ﬁscal year ended October 29, 2023 was a 52-week year.

Our ﬁeld application engineers, design engineers, and product and software development engineers are located in many places around the world, and
in many cases near our top customers. This enhances our customer reach and our visibility into new product opportunities and, in the case of our semiconductor
customers, enables us to support our customers in each stage of their product development cycle, from the early stages of production design to volume
manufacturing and future growth. By collaborating with our customers, we have opportunities to develop high value-added, customized products for them that
leverage our existing technologies. We anticipate that we will continue to make signiﬁcant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our
competitive position, and to ensure a continuous ﬂow of innovative and sustainable product platforms.
Customers, Sales and Distribution
       We sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of distributors and channel partners globally. Distributors and OEMs, or their
contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. A relatively small number of customers account for a signiﬁcant
portion of our net revenue. Sales to distributors accounted for 57% and 56% of our net revenue for ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe aggregate
sales to our top ﬁve end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 35% of our net revenue for each of our ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022. We
believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for approximately 20% of our net revenue for each of ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022. We
expect to continue to experience signiﬁcant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or signiﬁcant decrease in demand from, any of our top ﬁve end
customers could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.
       Many of our semiconductor customers design products in North America or Europe that are then manufactured in Asia. To serve customers around the
world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors
with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We also sell our products to a wide variety of OEMs or their contract manufacturers.

The following section generally discusses our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations for our ﬁscal year ended October 29, 2023 (“ﬁscal year 2023”)
compared to our ﬁscal year ended October 30, 2022 (“ﬁscal year 2022”). A discussion regarding our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations for ﬁscal year
2022 compared to our ﬁscal year ended October 31, 2021 (“ﬁscal year 2021”) can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for ﬁscal year
2022, ﬁled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 16, 2022.

Our ﬁeld application engineers, design engineers, and product and software development engineers are located in many places around the world, and
in many cases near our top customers. This enhances our customer reach and our visibility into new product opportunities and, in the case of our semiconductor
customers, enables us to support our customers in each stage of their product development cycle, from the early stages of production design to volume
manufacturing and future growth. By collaborating with our customers, we have opportunities to develop high value-added, customized products for them that
leverage our existing technologies. We anticipate that we will continue to make signiﬁcant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our
competitive position, and to ensure a continuous ﬂow of innovative and sustainable product platforms.
Customers, Sales and Distribution
       We sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of distributors and channel partners globally. Distributors and OEMs, or their
contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. A relatively small number of customers account for a signiﬁcant
portion of our net revenue. Sales to distributors accounted for 57% and 56% of our net revenue for ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe aggregate
sales to our top ﬁve end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 35% of our net revenue for each of our ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022. We
believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for approximately 20% of our net revenue for each of ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022. We
expect to continue to experience signiﬁcant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or signiﬁcant decrease in demand from, any of our top ﬁve end
customers could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.
       Many of our semiconductor customers design products in North America or Europe that are then manufactured in Asia. To serve customers around the
world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors
with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We also sell our products to a wide variety of OEMs or their contract manufacturers.

The following section generally discusses our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations for our ﬁscal year ended October 29, 2023 (“ﬁscal year 2023”)
compared to our ﬁscal year ended October 30, 2022 (“ﬁscal year 2022”). A discussion regarding our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations for ﬁscal year
2022 compared to our ﬁscal year ended October 31, 2021 (“ﬁscal year 2021”) can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for ﬁscal year
2022, ﬁled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 16, 2022.

Acquisi on of VMware, Inc.
        On November 22, 2023, we completed the acquisition of VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction (the “VMware Merger”). Pursuant to the Agreement and
Plan of Merger, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the eﬀective time of the VMware Merger was indirectly
converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520
shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder election was prorated, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive
cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, in each case, was equal to 50% of the aggregate
number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding. Based on the VMware stockholders’ elections, the VMware stockholders received
approximately $30.8 billion in cash and 54.4 million shares of Broadcom common stock in aggregate.
        We assumed all outstanding VMware restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed
awards were converted into approximately 5 million Broadcom RSU awards. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-
employee directors were accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts.
        VMware was a leading provider of multi-cloud services for all applications, enabling digital innovation with enterprise control. We acquired VMware to
enhance our infrastructure software capabilities.
        The preliminary purchase consideration for the VMware Merger was approximately $86.3 billion. We funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger with
net proceeds from the issuance of $30.4 billion in term loans under a credit agreement that we entered into on August 15, 2023 (the “2023 Credit Agreement”),

functions such as processing, amplifying and selectively ﬁltering electronic signals, controlling electronic system functions and processing, and transmitting and
storing data. Our digital and mixed signal products are based on silicon wafers with CMOS transistors oﬀering fast switching speeds and low power consumption,
which are both critical design factors for the markets we serve. We also oﬀer analog products, which are based on III-V semiconductor materials that have higher
electrical conductivity than silicon, and thus tend to have better performance characteristics in radio frequency (“RF”), and optoelectronic applications. III-V
refers to elements from the 3rd and 5th groups in the periodic table of chemical elements. Examples of these materials used in our products are gallium arsenide
(“GaAs”) and indium phosphide (“InP”).
        We provide semiconductor solutions for managing the movement of data in data center, service provider, and enterprise networking applications. We
provide a broad variety of RF semiconductor devices, wireless connectivity solutions, custom touch controllers and inductive charging solutions for the wireless
market. We also provide semiconductor solutions for enabling the STB and broadband access applications and for enabling secure movement of digital data to
and from host machines, such as servers, personal computers and storage systems, to the underlying storage devices, such as hard disk drives (“HDD”) and solid-
state drives (“SSD”).
        Our product portfolio ranges from discrete devices to complex sub-systems that include multiple device types and may also incorporate ﬁrmware for
interfacing between analog and digital systems.

experimenting with B2B blockchain payments.
      Value Added Service           Providers:      We   face competition      from   companies      that  provide    alternatives   to  our
value added services. This includes a wide range of players, such as technology companies, information services
and    consulting    firms,  governments        and   merchant      services    companies.      The    integration   of   technology     like
generative     AI  can   create    new    and   better   offerings   that  compete      with  our   value   added     services,   such    as
strengthened      risk  monitorization     and   managing     digital  identification.   Regulatory     initiatives  could   also   lead   to

number    of  credentials and     our acceptance footprint       help us to succeed. In addition, we          understand the needs of
the  individual   markets     in which    we   operate    and   partner    with  local  financial   institutions,  merchants,     fintechs,
governments, NGOs          and business organizations to provide tailored and innovative                solutions. We     will continue to
utilize our network of      networks strategy      to facilitate the  movement of       money. We      believe Visa     is well-positioned
competitively    due to our    global brand,     our broad set of payment products, new flows               offerings   and value    added
services, and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably.

Our total RL
investments were $18.02 billion in 2023 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are fundamentally
new technologies that we expect will evolve as the metaverse ecosystem develops, and many products for the metaverse may only be fully realized in the next
decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the metaverse ecosystem will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a
loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We
expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will
unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.

   It’s been 20 years since the Bank One-JPMorgan Chase merger — and it’s been

            and respect for the tremendous character and capabilities of the

to where we stand today. And I recognize that we all stand on the shoulders of many

and just under 6 million unemployed workers in the United
States, job skills training has never been needed more. We
already spend a tremendous amount of money on education —
just not the right way.
The second step is related to the first: Get more income to low-
paid workers. While this one would cost money, it is to me a
complete no-brainer since it is an expansion of an existing
program, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which many
Democrats and Republicans already agree upon. Today, the
EITC supplements low- to moderate-income working individuals
and couples, particularly with children and people living in rural
areas. For example, a single mother with two children earning
$9 an hour (approximately $20,000 a year) could receive a tax
credit of more than $6,000 at year-end. Workers without
children receive a very small tax credit (96% of all EITC dollars
were received by families with children). This should be
dramatically expanded, including eliminating the child
requirement from the calculation altogether. We should convert
the EITC to make it more like a negative income payroll tax,
paid monthly. Any tax credit income should not be offset by any
other benefits these individuals already receive (we have to
eliminate benefit “cliffs” that disincentivize work).
An increase in the EITC to a maximum of $10,000 would cost
tens of billions a year, but I have little doubt that these policy
changes would do more than anything else to lift up low-
income families and their communities. Well-paying jobs have
been shown to reduce crime, increase household formation,
improve health and reduce addiction. Both of these policies
would have the virtue of increasing the number of people in the
workforce. I also have little doubt that this would add to GDP.

insurance_documents,What percentage of the company's net revenue did sales to distributors account for in the fiscal years 2023 and 2022?,"Sales of products to distributors accounted for 57% and 56% of
our net revenue for ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Direct sales to WT Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a distributor, accounted for 21% and 20% of our net
revenue for ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe aggregate sales to our top ﬁve end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately
35% of our net revenue for each of ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022. We believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for approximately 20%
of our net revenue for each of ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022. We expect to continue to experience signiﬁcant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of,
or signiﬁcant decrease in demand from, any of our top ﬁve end customers could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of operations and
ﬁnancial condition.
        From time to time, some of our key semiconductor customers place large orders or delay orders, causing our quarterly net revenue to ﬂuctuate
signiﬁcantly. This is particularly true of our wireless products as ﬂuctuations may be magniﬁed by the timing of launches, and seasonal variations in sales, of
mobile devices. In addition, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and may cause our net revenue to ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly and impact our results
of operations.
        Although we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in Penang, Malaysia, we disclose net revenue by country
based primarily on the geographic shipment or delivery location speciﬁed by our distributors, OEMs, contract manufacturers, channel partners, or software
customers. In ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, 32% and 35%, respectively, of our net revenue came from shipments or deliveries to China (including Hong Kong).
However, the end customers for either our products or for the end products into which our products are incorporated, are frequently located in countries other
than China (including Hong Kong).

In ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, 32% and 35%, respectively, of our net revenue came from shipments or deliveries to China (including Hong Kong).
However, the end customers for either our products or for the end products into which our products are incorporated, are frequently located in countries other
than China (including Hong Kong). As a result, we believe that a substantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our
product or our customers’ product incorporating our product, to end customers located in China (including Hong Kong).

       Net revenue from our semiconductor solutions segment increased due to strong product demand, primarily for networking, server storage and broadband
products. Net revenue from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to increases in sales from our mainframe solutions, partially oﬀset by
lower demand for our FC SAN products.
Gross Margin
       Gross margin was $24,690 million, or 69% of net revenue, for ﬁscal year 2023, compared to $22,095 million, or 67% of net revenue, for ﬁscal year 2022. The
increase was primarily due to lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, mainly from our 2016 acquisition of Broadcom Corporation, partially
oﬀset by less favorable margin within our semiconductor soluti

Our ﬁeld application engineers, design engineers, and product and software development engineers are located in many places around the world, and
in many cases near our top customers. This enhances our customer reach and our visibility into new product opportunities and, in the case of our semiconductor
customers, enables us to support our customers in each stage of their product development cycle, from the early stages of production design to volume
manufacturing and future growth. By collaborating with our customers, we have opportunities to develop high value-added, customized products for them that
leverage our existing technologies. We anticipate that we will continue to make signiﬁcant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our
competitive position, and to ensure a continuous ﬂow of innovative and sustainable product platforms.
Customers, Sales and Distribution
       We sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of distributors and channel partners globally. Distributors and OEMs, or their
contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. A relatively small number of customers account for a signiﬁcant
portion of our net revenue. Sales to distributors accounted for 57% and 56% of our net revenue for ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe aggregate
sales to our top ﬁve end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 35% of our net revenue for each of our ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022. We
believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for approximately 20% of our net revenue for each of ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022. We
expect to continue to experience signiﬁcant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or signiﬁcant decrease in demand from, any of our top ﬁve end
customers could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.
       Many of our semiconductor customers design products in North America or Europe that are then manufactured in Asia. To serve customers around the
world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors
with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We also sell our products to a wide variety of OEMs or their contract manufacturers.

Manufacturing Operations
       We focus on maintaining an eﬃcient global supply chain and a variable, low-cost operating model. Accordingly, we outsource a majority of our
manufacturing operations, utilizing third-party foundry and assembly and test capabilities, as well as some of our corporate infrastructure functions. The majority
of our front-end wafer manufacturing operations is outsourced to external foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited
(“TSMC”). We use third-party contract manufacturers for a signiﬁcant majority of our assembly and test operations, including TSMC, Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering, Inc., Foxconn Technology Group, Amkor Technology, Inc. and Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd. We use our internal fabrication facilities for
products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes, such as our FBAR ﬁlters for wireless communications and our vertical-cavity surface emitting laser
and side emitting lasers-based on GaAs and InP lasers for ﬁber optic communications, while outsourcing commodity processes such as standard CMOS. By doing
so, we can protect our IP and accelerate time to market for our products. The majority of our internal III-V semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the U.S.
and Singapore.

                                                                                                         9 Table of Contents

       We also have a long history of operating in Asia where we manufacture and source the majority of our products and materials. We store the majority of our
product inventory in our warehouse in Malaysia and our presence in Asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers’ manufacturing facilities.
Manufacturing Materials and Suppliers
       Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials. We purchase
materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis.

To maintain supply of our products, we use
a variety of techniques, including comprehensive quality systems, inventory management, and back-up sites.

                                                                          19 However, pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary widely from product to
product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity is a very lengthy process requiring significant capital
expenditures, process modifications, and regulatory approvals. Accordingly, developments such as unanticipated
demand, unplanned plant shutdowns, manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at one of our facilities or
contracted facilities, failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities,
increases in demand on a supplier, or difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products and those
of our competitors have led, and may in the future lead, to interruption or higher costs in the supply of certain
products, product shortages, or pauses or discontinuations of product sales in one or more markets. For
example, we have experienced challenges in meeting strong demand for our incretin products in recent periods,
partially due to the limited availability of competitor therapies, and expect tight supply to persist while additional
manufacturing capacity is operationalized. Further, cost and wage inflation, availability of adequate capacity in
global transportation, supply chain complexities, including consolidation therein, labor market issues,
international tension and conflicts, uneven economic growth or downturns, an increase in overall demand in our
industry for certain products and materials, and public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic, have caused, and in the future may cause, delays or disruptions in and/or increased costs
related to distribution of our medicines, the construction or acquisition of manufacturing capacity, procurement
activity, and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements, as well as other general business impacts. For
more information on the additional risks we face in connection with any difficulties, disruptions, and shortages in
the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our products, see Item 1A, ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our

Quality Assurance
Our success depends in great measure on customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity
of the data that support their safety and effectiveness.

5 Project and portfolio management. The long-term success of ExxonMobil’s Upstream and Product Solutions businesses, as well as the future success of LCS and other
emerging lower-emission investments, depends on complex, long-term, capital-intensive projects. These projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise
to maximize efficiency. Specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to: negotiate successfully with joint venturers, partners,
governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize reservoir performance; develop markets for project outputs, whether through long-term contracts or the
development of effective spot markets; qualify for certain incentives available under supportive government policies for emerging markets and technologies; manage changes in
operating conditions and costs, including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping, supply-chain disruptions, and inflationary cost pressures;
prevent, to the extent possible, and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project start-up or cause unscheduled project downtime; and
influence the performance of project operators where ExxonMobil does not perform that role. In addition to the effective management of individual projects, ExxonMobil’s
success, including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to shareholders, depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio, including
diversification among types and locations of our projects, products produced, and strategies to acquire or divest assets. We may not be able to divest assets at a price or on the
timeline we contemplate in our strategies. Additionally, we may retain certain liabilities following a divestment and could be held liable for past use or for different liabilities
than anticipated.
The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.
Operational efficiency. An important component of ExxonMobil’s competitive performance, especially given the commodity-based nature of many of our businesses, is our
ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to manage expenses, improve production yields on an ongoing basis and successfully integrate and achieve the anticipated
synergies of acquisitions, including the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Company.

See Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Late-Stage Pipeline,"" for more
information on our late-stage product candidates.
Raw Materials and Product Supply
Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source.
However, certain raw or intermediate materials are procured from a single source. We seek to maintain sufficient
inventory to provide reliability of production and manage unforeseen supply variability. However, various
developments have led, and may in the future lead, to interruption or shortages in supply until we establish new
sources, implement alternative processes, bring new manufacturing facilities online, or pause or discontinue
product sales in one or more markets.
The majority of our revenue comes from products produced predominantly in our own facilities. Our principal
active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, and Ireland. Finishing
operations, including formulation, filling, assembling, delivery device manufacturing, and packaging, take place at
a number of sites throughout the world. To support anticipated demand for our current and prospective products,
we have undertaken significant manufacturing expansion initiatives. During 2023, commercial production
commenced at our Research Triangle Park manufacturing site in Durham, North Carolina. Further investments to
increase our manufacturing capacity include planned sites in Concord, North Carolina, Limerick, Ireland, Alzey,
Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, and two in Lebanon, Indiana. We also utilize and are expanding arrangements
with third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing, filling, finishing operations, and for device or
component production and assembly.
We manage our supply chain (including our own facilities, contracted arrangements, and inventory) in a way that
is intended to allow us to meet product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity
to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. To maintain supply of our products, we use
a variety of techniques, including comprehensive quality systems, inventory management, and back-up sites.

                                                                          19 However, pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary widely from product to

expenditures, process modifications, and regulatory approvals.

Sales of products to distributors accounted for 57% of the company's net revenue in fiscal year 2023 and 56% in fiscal year 2022.","The company maintains an efficient manufacturing operation through several strategies:

1. **Outsourcing**: A majority of manufacturing operations are outsourced to third-party foundries and contract manufacturers, such as TSMC, Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, and Foxconn Technology Group. This allows the company to focus on its internal fabrication facilities for proprietary processes while outsourcing commodity processes.

2. **Global Supply Chain**: The company emphasizes a global supply chain and a variable, low-cost operating model, which helps in managing costs and efficiency.

3. **Proximity to Customers**: Manufacturing and sourcing are primarily conducted in Asia, with a significant presence in Malaysia, which places the company close to many customers' manufacturing facilities.

4. **Quality Systems and Inventory Management**: The company employs comprehensive quality systems and inventory management techniques to ensure a reliable supply of products.

5. **Flexibility in Manufacturing Capacity**: The company manages its supply chain to allow for flexibility in reallocating manufacturing capacity in response to changes in supply and demand.

Operational efficiency. An important component of ExxonMobil’s competitive performance, especially given the commodity-based nature of many of our businesses, is our
ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to manage expenses, improve production yields on an ongoing basis and successfully integrate and achieve the anticipated
synergies of acquisitions, including the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Company.

See Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Late-Stage Pipeline,"" for more
information on our late-stage product candidates.
Raw Materials and Product Supply
Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source.
However, certain raw or intermediate materials are procured from a single source. We seek to maintain sufficient
inventory to provide reliability of production and manage unforeseen supply variability. However, various
developments have led, and may in the future lead, to interruption or shortages in supply until we establish new
sources, implement alternative processes, bring new manufacturing facilities online, or pause or discontinue
product sales in one or more markets.
The majority of our revenue comes from products produced predominantly in our own facilities. Our principal
active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, and Ireland. Finishing
operations, including formulation, filling, assembling, delivery device manufacturing, and packaging, take place at
a number of sites throughout the world. To support anticipated demand for our current and prospective products,
we have undertaken significant manufacturing expansion initiatives. During 2023, commercial production
commenced at our Research Triangle Park manufacturing site in Durham, North Carolina. Further investments to
increase our manufacturing capacity include planned sites in Concord, North Carolina, Limerick, Ireland, Alzey,
Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, and two in Lebanon, Indiana. We also utilize and are expanding arrangements
with third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing, filling, finishing operations, and for device or
component production and assembly.
We manage our supply chain (including our own facilities, contracted arrangements, and inventory) in a way that
is intended to allow us to meet product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity
to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. To maintain supply of our products, we use
a variety of techniques, including comprehensive quality systems, inventory management, and back-up sites.

                                                                          19 However, pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary widely from product to
product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity is a very lengthy process requiring significant capital
expenditures, process modifications, and regulatory approvals.

The company maintains an efficient manufacturing operation through several strategies:

1. **Outsourcing**: A majority of manufacturing operations are outsourced to third-party foundries and contract manufacturers, such as TSMC, Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, and Foxconn Technology Group. This allows the company to focus on its internal fabrication facilities for proprietary processes while outsourcing commodity processes.

2. **Global Supply Chain**: The company emphasizes a global supply chain and a variable, low-cost operating model, which helps in managing costs and efficiency.

3. **Proximity to Customers**: Manufacturing and sourcing are primarily conducted in Asia, with a significant presence in Malaysia, which places the company close to many customers' manufacturing facilities.

4. **Quality Systems and Inventory Management**: The company employs comprehensive quality systems and inventory management techniques to ensure a reliable supply of products.

5. **Flexibility in Manufacturing Capacity**: The company manages its supply chain to allow for flexibility in reallocating manufacturing capacity in response to changes in supply and demand.

Intellectual Property
       Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights,
trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar IP, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants,
and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. We believe our current product expertise, key engineering talent and IP portfolio provide us with a
strong platform from which to develop application speciﬁc products in key target markets.
       As of October 29, 2023, we had 15,400 U.S. and other patents and 910 U.S. and other pending patent applications. The expiration dates of our patents
range from 2023 to 2042, with a small number of patents expiring in the near future, none of

which are expected to be material to our IP portfolio. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.
       We focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our
products, as contrasted with more basic research. However, we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or
the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims.
       We and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of IP licensing and cross-licensing arrangements that have both beneﬁted our business and
enabled some of our competitors. A portion of our revenue comes from IP licensing royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such IP. We also
license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities, products and manufacturing processes. Historically, licenses of
the third-party technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms.
       The industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the
vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products.

(together, “Masimo”) filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC”) alleging
infringement by the Company of five patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo
sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality.
On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the “Order”) prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with
blood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the end of the administrative review
period, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to appeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal.

Other Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The
Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial
condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting
period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.

insurance_documents, How could the failure of software products to manage and secure IT infrastructures and environments impact the business?,"If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our
purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, or we
may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of
which would reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross
margin and operating income.
Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital to our business.
Failure to successfully execute IT projects and have IT systems available to our business would
adversely impact our operations.
IT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business. These systems are utilized to process a very
high volume of transactions, conduct payment transactions, track and value our inventory and produce
reports critical for making business decisions. Failure or disruption of these systems could have an
adverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers, produce goods in our
manufacturing plants, move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to
our members. We are undertaking large technology and IT transformation projects. The failure of these
projects could adversely impact our business plans and potentially impair our day to day business
operations. Given the high volume of transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital
resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications

                                                                  11 failures, viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events
such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes. Any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems,
data centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore IT
services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business
services, increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members. We are
currently making substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or
delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business. Failure to deliver IT transformation
efforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact
our financial condition and results of operations. Insufficient IT capacity could also impact our capacity for
timely, complete and accurate financial and non-financial reporting required by law.

We are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst
multiplying threat landscapes and in compliance with privacy and data protection regulations
globally.

Any failure of these internal or third-party systems and services to operate eﬀectively could disrupt our operations and could have
a material adverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our IT
infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a signiﬁcant disruptive eﬀect. Although these systems are designed to protect and
secure our customers’, suppliers’ and employees’ conﬁdential information, as well as our own proprietary information, we are, out of necessity, dependent on
our vendors to adequately address cyber security threats to their own systems. In addition, software products we use and technologies produced by us have
occasionally had in the past and may have in the future, vulnerabilities that, if left unmitigated, could reduce the overall level of security of the systems on which
the software is installed.
      Cyber-attacks are increasing in number and sophistication, are well-ﬁnanced, in some cases supported by state actors, and are designed to not only attack,
but also to evade detection. Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems, or to otherwise sabotage them, change frequently and are
often not recognized until launched against a target, we

                                                                                                        19 Table of Contents

may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. As a critical vendor in the digital supply chain for both
governmental entities and critical infrastructure operators, we and our products may be targeted by those seeking to threaten the conﬁdentiality, integrity and
availability of systems supporting essential public services. Geopolitical instability may increase the likelihood that we will experience direct or collateral
consequences from cyber conﬂicts between nation-states or other politically motivated actors targeting critical technology infrastructure.
      Accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our information systems or the systems of our service providers and business
partners, or the existence of computer viruses or malware (such as ransomware) in our or their data or software have in the past, and could in the future, expose
us to a risk of information loss, business disruption, and misappropriation of proprietary and conﬁdential information, including information relating to our
products or customers and the personal information of our employees or third parties.

Open source licenses are generally “as-is” and do not
provide warranties, support or assurance of title or controls on origin of the software, which exposes us to potential liability if the software fails to work or
infringes the intellectual property of a third-party.
      Although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions and exposing us to unacceptable ﬁnancial
risk, such use, under certain circumstances, could materially adversely aﬀect our business, ﬁnancial condition and operating results and cash ﬂow, including if we
are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development eﬀorts. In addition, we may receive inquiries or claims from authors,
distributors or recipients of open source software included in our products regarding our compliance with the conditions of such open source licenses and we
may be required to take steps to avoid or remedy an alleged infringement or noncompliance, including modifying our product code, stopping the distribution of
some of our products, paying damages or releasing the source code of our propriety software. Further, although we believe that we have complied with our
obligations under the licenses for such open source software, there is little legal precedent governing the interpretation of some terms in some of these licenses,
which increases the risk that a court could interpret the licenses diﬀerently than we do.
 Failure of our so ware products to manage and secure IT infrastructures and environments could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business.
      Certain aspects of our software products are intended to manage and secure IT infrastructures and environments, and as a result, we expect these products
to be ongoing targets of cyber-attacks. Open source code or other third-party software used in these products could also be targeted and may make our products
vulnerable to additional security risks not posed by purely proprietary products. Our products are complex and, when deployed, may contain errors, defects or
security vulnerabilities, some of which may not be discovered before the product has been released, installed and used by customers. The complexity and
breadth of our technical and production environments, which involve globally dispersed development and engineering teams, increases the risk that errors,
defects or vulnerabilities will be introduced and may delay our ability to detect, mitigate or remediate such incidents.
      In the past, elements of our proprietary source code have been exposed in an unauthorized manner.

insurance_documents,How could growing public concern over the concentration of economic power in corporations impact a company's business operations?,"Growing public concern over concentration of economic
power in corporations is likely to result in increased anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity. Involvement in
regulatory investigations or inquiries, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical
personnel.
      If any pending or future governmental investigations result in an unfavorable resolution, we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the
subject products or technology, pay ﬁnes or disgorge proﬁts or other payments, and/or cease certain conduct and/or modify our contracting or business
practices, which could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations. We may be obligated to indemnify our
current or former directors or employees, or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired, in connection with regulatory investigations.
These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of government, law enforcement or regulatory investigations and civil or
criminal ﬁnes and penalties.
      In addition, the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with various laws and adapt to changes in regulatory requirements as they
occur. For example, if a country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards that are not widely shared, it may require us to stop
distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new standards, lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that
country, require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with diﬀerent technical standards and disrupt cross-border

                                                                                                         16 Table of Contents

manufacturing relationships, any of which could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations. If we fail to comply
with these requirements, we could also be required to pay civil penalties or face criminal prosecution.
 Global poli cal and economic condi ons and other factors related to our interna onal opera ons could adversely aﬀect our business, ﬁnancial condi on and
results of opera ons.
      A majority of our products are produced, sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents a signiﬁcant percentage of our overall
revenue. In addition, as of October 29, 2023, nearly 49% of our employees were located outside the U.S.

Our large
statutory surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-
paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profits.
Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings.
        Each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage our
businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive
advantages, many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages.
Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully protecting and
enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating
results in the future may decline.
Unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to
access capital markets at a reasonable cost.
        Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy or the specific industries
in which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions, including significant inflation over a prolonged period
could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy
businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures and depend on having
access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is
restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected.
Epidemics, pandemics or other similar outbreaks could hurt our operating businesses.
        The outbreak of epidemics, pandemics or other similar outbreaks in the future may adversely affect our operations,
including the value of our equity securities portfolio. This may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by
governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit
losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities
markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses.
Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results.
        Over time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues,
regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere.

In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend sales to these
customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations. The U.S. government may also add companies to its restricted
entity list and/or technologies to its list of prohibited exports to speciﬁc countries, which have had and may continue to have an adverse eﬀect on our ability to
sell our products and our revenue. For example, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., one of our customers, is subject to certain U.S. export restrictions, which has
required us to suspend sales to Huawei until we obtain licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. We may be unable to obtain or maintain the necessary
licenses to allow us to export products to them. These restrictive governmental actions and any similar measures that may be imposed on U.S. companies by
other governments, especially in light of ongoing trade tensions with China, will likely limit or prevent us from doing business with certain of our customers or
suppliers and harm our ability to compete eﬀectively or otherwise negatively aﬀect our ability to sell our products, and adversely aﬀect our business and results
of operations. Furthermore, government authorities may take retaliatory actions, impose conditions for the supply of products or require the license or other
transfer of intellectual property, which could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business.
      Our products and operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory agencies, such as the FTC. From time to time, we may also be
involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries, such as the ongoing investigation by the Korean Fair Trade Commission into certain of
our contracting and business practices, which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings. Growing public concern over concentration of economic
power in corporations is likely to result in increased anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity. Involvement in
regulatory investigations or inquiries, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical
personnel.

Although Meta is not a defendant in these actions, the Supreme Court's decision and ultimate resolution of the
lawsuit could impact our business.

         In addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil,
Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including
our obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties
against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously
defend such fines and penalties.

         We are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary
course of business, and we expect to be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes in the future.

PART II

Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Market Information for Common Stock

              Our Class A common stock is trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol 'META'. This replaced the ticker symbol 'FB,' which
had been used since the company's initial public offering in 2012. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our stock.

              Our Class B common stock is not listed on any stock exchange nor traded on any public market.

Holders of Record

              As of December 31, 2023, there were 3,098 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock, and the closing price of our Class A common stock
was $353.96 per share as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held by brokers and other
institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. As of December 31,
2023, there were 23 stockholders of record of our Class B common stock.

Dividend Policy

              Prior to 2024, we had never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. On February 1, 2024 we announced the initiation of our first ever
cash dividend program.

statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and are subject to the safe harbor created thereby under the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate
solely to historical or current facts, and generally can be identified by the use of words such as ""may,"" ""could,""

Forward-looking statements inherently involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on
management's current plans and expectations, expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable
basis. However, we can give no assurance that any expectation or belief will result or will be achieved or
accomplished.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the
related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical
consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual
results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those
discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the
measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant
currency basis is presented in the section entitled ""—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue."" To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we
translated revenue for the full year 2023 using 2022 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full

           This Meta Platforms, Inc. Compensation Recoupment Policy (the “Policy”) has been adopted by the Compensation, Nominating & Governance
Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Meta Platforms, Inc. (the “Company”) on June 1, 2023. This Policy provides for the recoupment of
certain executive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under
U.S. federal securities laws in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. This Policy is intended to comply with the requirements of Section
10D of the Exchange Act (as defined below) and Section 5608 of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.

     1.    Definitions.

The term ""Family"" refers to our Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and
WhatsApp products. For references to accessing Meta's products on the ""web"" or via a ""website,"" such terms refer to accessing such products on personal
computers. For references to accessing Meta's products on ""mobile,"" such term refers to accessing such products via a mobile application or via a mobile-
optimized version of our websites such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet.

                                                                                                     3 Table of Contents

                                                               LIMITATIONS OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER DATA

         The numbers for our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. We report our estimates of the
numbers of our daily active people (DAP), monthly active people (MAP), and average revenue per person (ARPP) (collectively, our ""Family metrics"") based
on the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our ""Family"" of products) during the
applicable period of measurement. We have historically reported the numbers of our daily active users (DAUs), monthly active users (MAUs), and average
revenue per user (ARPU) (collectively, our ""Facebook metrics"") based on user activity only on Facebook and Messenger and not on our other products. We
believe our Family metrics better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our products. Beginning with our
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed for the first quarter of 2024, we will no longer report DAUs, MAUs, ARPU, and MAP in our periodic reports filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but will continue reporting DAP and ARPP (calculated based on DAP).

         While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are
inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these
metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our
estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology.

•    Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 2.11 billion on average for December 2023, an increase of 6% year-over-year.
   •    Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 3.07 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 3% year-over-year.
   •    Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 28% year-over-year in 2023, and the average price per ad decreased by 9% year-over-
        year in 2023.

        Beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed for the first quarter of 2024, we will no longer report DAUs, MAUs, ARPU, and MAP in
our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We intend to begin reporting year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions
delivered and the average price per ad by geographic region, while continuing to report DAP and ARPP (calculated based on DAP), beginning with our
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed for the first quarter of 2024. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and
Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Developments in Advertising

        Substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on targeting and measurement tools that
incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our
advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targeting
and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.

        In particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including its evolving interpretation through
decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive, the European Digital Services Act, and U.S. state privacy laws including the
California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and we
expect these and other

                                                                                                     61 Table of Contents

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the
related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical
consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual
results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those
discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the
measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant

Family Metrics

         Many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual
product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not
reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,
Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and
therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex
techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user
accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of
accounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are
subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which itself is
subject to error as well.

These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are

subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be
approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people,
and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error
margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.

         To calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews
of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these
estimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information,
IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which
are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our

insurance_documents, How does limited visibility into encrypted products like WhatsApp affect the company's ability to match user accounts and report Family metrics?,"4 Table of Contents

Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to
others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on
phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our
process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or
legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics
at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies,
product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across
our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating
accounts (as defined below).

         We regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of ""violating"" accounts. We define ""violating""
accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of
2023, we estimated that approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a
limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors
associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due
to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts
estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make
product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP estimates in a
particular period.

percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 4% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false

our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook.

User Geography

         Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed
location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location
of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location.

The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of
accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP
addresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the
reviewers. Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile

         Other data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline in
usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age.

Facebook Metrics

         We regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of ""duplicate"" and ""false"" accounts among our MAUs. A duplicate account is one
that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide ""false"" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users
have created personal profiles for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than
a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that
violate our terms of service, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of
accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP
addresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the

1. **Data Signals**: Facebook uses data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar usernames to identify duplicate accounts. For false accounts, they look for names that appear to be fake or other inauthentic behaviors.

2. **Internal Review**: The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, applying significant judgment in the determination process.

3. **Evolving Methodologies**: The methodologies used to estimate these accounts may evolve over time, incorporating new data signals or technologies that could help identify previously undetected accounts.

4. **User Behavior Monitoring**: Facebook monitors user behavior to detect patterns that may indicate the presence of false accounts, such as the creation of accounts that violate their terms of service.

5. **Geographic Considerations**: The company notes that the percentage of duplicate accounts is higher in developing markets compared to more developed markets, which may influence their identification methods.

6. **Account Disabling and Product Changes**: Facebook periodically disables certain user accounts and makes product changes to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts, which can also affect their DAU and MAU estimates.

These methods highlight the complexity and challenges Facebook faces in accurately measuring duplicate and false accounts at scale.","The methodologies used to estimate the geographic location of users include factors such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. However, these estimates may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For instance, a user might appear to be accessing a service from the location of a proxy server rather than their true location. 

Several factors can affect the accuracy of these estimates, including:

1. **Technical Errors**: The methodologies are susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors.
2. **Data Limitations**: Limited visibility into certain products can restrict the data signals available for accurate estimation.
3. **User Behavior**: Users may provide inaccurate self-disclosed location data.
4. **Proxy Servers**: Users accessing services through proxy servers can misrepresent their actual geographic location.
5. **Software Bugs and Human Error**: Metrics and estimates can be impacted by software bugs and inconsistencies in systems.

These factors contribute to the challenges in accurately estimating user locations.",NASDAQ_FB_2023.pdf_70 and NASDAQ_FB_2023.pdf_8 and NASDAQ_FB_2023.pdf_65,2024-09-20 17:01:56
insurance_documents,What factors can lead to changes in the stability or accuracy of estimates of duplicate and false accounts according to the text?,"The principal considerations for our determination that
performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan
losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale
and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are
(i) the significant judgment and estimation by management
in the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S.
unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the
Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect
its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet
date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by
management in determining the quantitative calculation
utilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to
take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are
not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate,
which both in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment,
subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in
evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit
loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments
to the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort
involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
These procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses,
including controls over model validation and generation of
macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included,
among others, testing management’s process for estimating
the allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating
the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used
in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the
reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S.
real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness
and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv)
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s
adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts of
model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and
other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected
in the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included
the use of professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of
certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic
variables.

At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods
depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain
and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as
long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
        The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.
Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an
ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.

                                                                                                     35         The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return
reserves, the collectability of accounts and financing receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of
financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have
assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially
affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new
events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of
accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP
addresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the
reviewers. Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile
platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts.
Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may
allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate and
false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our
estimates.

         In the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 10% of our worldwide MAUs. We believe the
percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 4% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false
accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as
Indonesia, Vietnam, and Nigeria. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of
duplicate or false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period.

         Other data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline in
usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age.
Accordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete.

Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile
platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts.

         The numbers of DAUs and MAUs discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as ARPU, do not include users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or
our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook.

User Geography

         Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed
location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location
of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location.

The methodologies used to estimate the geographic location of users include factors such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. However, these estimates may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For instance, a user might appear to be accessing a service from the location of a proxy server rather than their true location.

NOTE 2
SEGMENT INFORMATION
Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health
Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of:
•     Beauty: Hair Care (Conditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirants and
      Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care);
•     Grooming: Grooming (Appliances, Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other
      Grooming);
•     Health Care: Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Pain Relief,
      Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care);
•     Fabric & Home Care: Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care,
      Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); and
•     Baby, Feminine & Family Care: Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence,
      Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper).
While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Appliances
(Grooming) and Personal Health Care (Health), are seasonal.
The accounting policies of the segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1. Differences between these policies
and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the segments using applicable blended statutory rates.
Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. In addition, capital expenditures in the segments are on
an accrual basis consistent with the balance sheet. Adjustments to move from an accrual to cash basis, for purposes of the cash
flow statement, are reflected in Corporate.
Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not reflected in the operating results used internally to
measure and evaluate the businesses, as well as items to adjust management reporting principles to U.S. GAAP.

The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes
certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the
Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an
FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that
receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in
the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities. These financial measures allow


management to assess the comparability of revenue from
year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt
sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to
tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.
These adjustments have no impact on net income as
reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.
Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial
measures at the Firm and business-segment level because
these other non-GAAP financial measures provide
information to investors about the underlying operational
performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular
business segment, as the case may be, and therefore
facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment
with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to
Business Segment Results on pages 65–85 for additional
information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP
financial measures used by the Firm may not be
comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies.

sales.

As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.1 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30,
2023, the Company expects 67% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 1%
in greater than three years.

The factors that can lead to changes in the stability or accuracy of estimates of duplicate and false accounts include:

1. **Loss of Access to Data Signals**: Any loss of access to data signals used to identify duplicate and false accounts, due to product decisions, actions by third-party platforms, or regulatory requirements, can impact estimates.

2. **Evolving Methodologies**: Changes in methodologies, such as the application of new data signals or technologies, can alter the ability to identify previously undetected accounts.

3. **Difficulties in Measurement**: The inherent difficulty in measuring duplicate and false accounts at scale can lead to significant variations between actual numbers and estimates.

4. **Episodic Spikes**: Variations in the creation of false accounts can occur due to episodic spikes, particularly in specific countries.

5. **Product Changes and Account Disabling**: Actions taken to reduce duplicate or false accounts, such as disabling user accounts or making product changes, may also affect estimates.

These factors highlight the complexities involved in accurately estimating duplicate and false accounts.","The company reports its financial results under two segments: **Products** and **Subscriptions and Services**. 

- **Products**: This segment includes revenue from various product categories such as Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care, Grooming, Oral Care, and more.
- **Subscriptions and Services**: This segment encompasses revenue generated from subscription-based offerings and related services.

insurance_documents,: What percentage of Reality Labs operating expenses is expected to be spent on AR initiatives in 2024?,"We have continued to advance our augmented reality (AR) roadmap to include offerings such as the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which feature Meta
AI, our advanced conversational assistant, as well as offer the ability to livestream video and let people stay more present through hands-free interaction. We
also offer Meta Spark, a platform that allows creators and businesses to build AR experiences that bring the digital and physical worlds together in our apps.

         In general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the metaverse, our VR and social platform efforts also include
notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to go to market, whereas our AR efforts are primarily directed toward longer-term
research and development projects. For example, in 2024, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating expenses on our AR initiatives,
approximately 40% on our VR (including MR) initiatives, and approximately 10% on social platforms and other initiatives. We apply significant judgment in
estimating this expense breakdown as there are certain shared costs across product lines, and our expectations are subject to change, including as the metaverse
ecosystem and our business strategies evolve. In particular, we regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of
the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve.

Competition

         Our business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies providing connection, sharing,
discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or
develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but
not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content and information online or

                                                                                                      8 Table of Contents

enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain
businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with
our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services.

Across our work, we are
innovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful, and immersive.

         We report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from
selling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a
range of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook,
Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content.

         We invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2024, we intend to focus on six key investment areas: AI, the metaverse, our discovery
engine, monetization of our products and services, regulatory readiness, and enhancing developer efficiency to build, iterate, and optimize products quickly.
Our AI investments support initiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery engine that
recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences, and the tools that make our
product development more efficient and productive.

         The majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2023, 80% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in
FoA and 20% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $70.13 billion in 2023 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical
infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts,
including developing virtual and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our total RL
investments were $18.02 billion in 2023 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are fundamentally
new technologies that we expect will evolve as the metaverse ecosystem develops, and many products for the metaverse may only be fully realized in the next
decade.

Any of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory actions against us.

We incur significant expenses in operating our business, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in Reality Labs, have the effect of
reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be
harmed.

         We incur significant expenses in operating our business, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base, as
users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement
new products, as we market new and existing products and promote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest
in new and unproven technologies, including AI and machine learning, and as we continue our efforts to focus on privacy, safety, security, and content review.
We have recently undertaken cost reduction measures in light of a more challenging operating environment, which may adversely affect these or other business
initiatives, and some of these measures have involved, and may in the future involve, up-front charges and outlays of cash to reduce certain longer-term
expenses. In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments, fines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory
developments that may be material to our business. We are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies, including as part of
our efforts related to building the metaverse. Some of these investments, particularly our significant investments in Reality Labs, have generated only limited
revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable
future. For example, our investments in Reality Labs reduced our 2023 overall operating profit by approximately $16.12 billion, and we expect our Reality
Labs investments and operating losses to increase meaningfully in 2024. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial
performance will be harmed.

Our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our products and services
could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.

The company reports its financial results under two segments: **Products** and **Subscriptions and Services**. 

- **Products**: This segment includes revenue from various product categories such as Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care, Grooming, Oral Care, and more.
- **Subscriptions and Services**: This segment encompasses revenue generated from subscription-based offerings and related services.

insurance_documents,: What are some of the key areas where the company is making significant investments in technology,"We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain
businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with
our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services. We also
expect to face additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products
and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse or innovate through the development and application of new technologies such as AI.

Technology

         Our product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means that
our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with
products like video, VR, and MR increases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We have designed
and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure, and a substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is also provided by third
parties. Our ability to provide and continue to innovate our products and services depends on the continued availability of components, power, and network
capacity.

         We make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers
and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen
our systems against abuse. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things,
recommend relevant content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, enhance our advertising tools and improve our ad delivery,
targeting, and measurement capabilities, and to develop new products as well as new features for existing products.

Sales and Operations

         The majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force that
is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-
making to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers.

Markets business.

Several risks remain. Economies are still
adjusting to life after the pandemic and
the injection of trillions of dollars in
monetary and fiscal stimulus; geopolitical
challenges continue to flare; and the
competitive threat is intensifying. The
outcome of these is inherently unknown
— they could provide both headwinds and
opportunities for our business.
The consistent returns created by the scale
and diversity of our franchise allow us to
keep investing through economic cycles.

We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties,
formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement
across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services
in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels,
which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect
our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.

We may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.

         We believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in
social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life. We expect this will be a
complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well
as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not
develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build for the metaverse is uncertain. We regularly
evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas
and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology, which
may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are
unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products,
systems, networks, or standards. Our metaverse efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business.

Facts and details matter
and inform a deeper and deeper analysis that
allows you to continually revise and update your
plans. This, of course, also means that you are
constantly admitting prior mistakes.
You need to shed sacred cows, seek out blind
spots and challenge the status quo.
Very often companies or individuals develop nar-
ratives based upon beliefs that are very hard to
dislodge but are often wrong — and they can lead
to terrible mistakes. A few examples will suffice.
Stripe, Inc. built a payments business by working
with developers — something we never would
have imagined but might have figured out if we
had tried to seek out what others were doing in
this area. Branches were being closed, both at
Bank One and Chase, because the assumption
was that they would not be needed in the future.
We underinvested for years in the wealth man-
agement business because we were always
focused on the value of deposits versus invest-
ments. Question everything.

            40      MANAGEMENT LESSONS: THINKING, DECIDING AND TAKING ACTION — DELIBERATELY AND WITH HEART Use your brains to figure out the truth — not to
justify what you already think.
It’s often hard to change your own attitudes and
beliefs, especially those you may have held on to
for some time. But you must be open to it. When
you learn something that is different from what
you thought, it may affect many conclusions you
have, not just one. Try not to allow yourself to
become rigid or “weaponized,” where other
employees or interest groups jazz you up so much
that you become a weapon on their behalf. This
makes it much harder to see things clearly for
yourself. When people disagree with you, seek
out where they may be partially right. This opens
the door for a deeper understanding and avoids
binary thinking.
It’s hard to see certain long-term trends, but
you must try.
There is too much emphasis on short-term,
monthly data and too little on long-term trends
and on what might happen in the future that would
influence long-term outcomes. For example, today
there is tremendous interest in monthly inflation
data, although it seems to me that every long-term
trend I see increases inflation relative to the last
20 years.

In 2024, it is expected that approximately 50% of Reality Labs operating expenses will be spent on augmented reality (AR) initiatives.","The company is making significant investments in several key areas of technology, including:

insurance_documents,What are some of the legislative acts mentioned that could impact business operations in the European Union? ,"Content-related legislation also has required us, and may require us in the future, to change our products
or business practices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies. For example, the
European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the
availability of that content, which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the European
Copyright Directive may also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our products and services are subject to restrictions and requirements,
and we are subject to increased compliance costs, as a result of the Digital Services Act in the European Union, which started to apply to our business as of
August 2023, and other content-related legislative developments such as the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act in Ireland and the Online Safety Act in
the United Kingdom. Certain countries have also implemented or proposed legislation that may require us to pay publishers for certain news content shared on
our products. For example, as a result of such legislation in Canada, we have removed the availability of news content for Canadian users on Facebook and
Instagram. In the United States, changes to the protections available under Section 230 or the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or new state or federal
content-related legislation may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect
user growth and engagement.

         Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.

                                                                                                       44 Table of Contents

Payment-related activities may subject us to additional regulatory requirements, regulatory actions, and other risks that could be costly and difficult to
comply with or that could harm our business.

         Several of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase tangible, virtual, and digital goods from merchants and
developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send money to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among
other activities. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money
laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual
currency, consumer protection, charitable fundraising, economic sanctions, and import and export restrictions.

Further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the
      Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could
      influence tax laws in countries in which we operate, such as the recent enactments by both the EU and
      non-EU countries of a global minimum tax. Modifications to key elements of the U.S. or international tax
      framework could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows.

•     Regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company.
      The marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the
      manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to
      extensive scrutiny and regulation. Many companies, including us, are and have been subject to
      investigations, litigation, and claims related to these practices asserted by governmental authorities and

                                                                        34 other parties. These investigations, litigation, and claims have resulted in substantial expense and other
significant consequences. The final outcomes of such investigations, litigation, and claims include criminal
charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or non-monetary remedies, including exclusion from U.S.
federal and other healthcare programs. Such investigations, litigation, and claims have intensified and
may continue to intensify as a result of evolving U.S. and foreign regulatory priorities. New business
practices or commercial capabilities may subject us to additional scrutiny over compliance with applicable
regulatory schemes and compliance obligations or expose us to new regulatory schemes and compliance
obligations entirely. In addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with cGMP, quality assurance,
evolving standards, and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as
nitrosamines, and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards)
for our products in some cases lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines
and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import
certifications, delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of
current products pending resolution of the issues, and reputational harm, any of which adversely affects
our business.

Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European
Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our
business. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the
combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key
requirements will be enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies beginning in March 2024. The DMA has caused, and may in the future cause, us to
incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further
interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could have
similar effects. We are also subject to content-related legislation such as the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union, which started to apply to our
business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and requirements for our products and services, and subjects us to increased compliance costs. The
DSA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries, such as India and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation
implementing data protection requirements, new competition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could
require substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and
services in certain countries, and/or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use
information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain
jurisdictions.

As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for
non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations. In
addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on
products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act,
and similar laws recently enacted by other states also establish certain transparency rules and create certain data privacy rights for users. Some states have also
proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like
comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to
all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising business. In addition, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive and national
implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes
to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising
business. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook
and Instagram in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland from ""legitimate interests"" to ""consent,"" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a
""subscription for no ads"" alternative. We are continuing to engage with regulators on our new consent model, including regarding compliance with
requirements under the GDPR, Digital Markets Act (DMA), and EU consumer laws. These or any similar developments in the future may negatively impact
our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European
Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our
business. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the
combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design.

The company is making significant investments in several key areas of technology, including:

1. **AI Initiatives**: This includes generative AI to enhance content recommendations, improve advertising tools, and develop new products and features.

Restructuring

        Beginning in 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. As of December 31,
2023, we have completed the data center initiatives and the employee layoffs, and substantially completed the facilities consolidation initiatives.

        A summary of our restructuring charges, including subsequent adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2023 by major activity type is as follows

        During 2023 and 2022, we recognized total pre-tax restructuring charges of $2.84 billion and $4.10 billion under our FoA segment, and $612 million and
$515 million under our RL segment, respectively.

        See Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding restructuring charges.

Family of Apps Metrics

   •    Family daily active people (DAP) was 3.19 billion on average for December 2023, an increase of 8% year-over-year.
   •    Family monthly active people (MAP) was 3.98 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 6% year-over-year.
   •    Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 2.11 billion on average for December 2023, an increase of 6% year-over-year.
   •    Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 3.07 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 3% year-over-year.

Included in the balance at December 31, 2023, were $420 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective
tax rate. We do not expect material increases to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits during 2024.
        On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“the 2022 Act”) was signed into law. The 2022 Act contains
numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax (“CAMT”) on “adjusted financial statement
income”, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions
of the 2022 Act are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The extent to which the Company incurs CAMT
will depend on the facts and circumstances of the given tax year. We do not expect to incur a CAMT liability in 2023. The
Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of Treasury may release additional guidance in the future. We will continue
to evaluate the impact of the 2022 Act as more guidance becomes available.
        The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a new
global minimum tax of 15% intended to be effective on January 1, 2024. While the U.S. has not yet adopted the Pillar Two
rules, various other governments around the world are enacting legislation. As currently designed, Pillar Two will ultimately
apply to our worldwide operations. Considering we do not have material operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than
the Pillar Two minimum, these rules are not expected to materially increase our global tax costs. There remains uncertainty as
to the final Pillar Two model rules. We will continue to monitor U.S. and global legislative action related to Pillar Two for
potential impacts.

                                                                              K-104  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(21) Fair value measurements
        Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below, with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy
(in millions). The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills, other receivables and accounts payable,
accruals and other liabilities are considered to be reasonable estimates of or otherwise approximate the fair values.

Human Capital

         At Meta, everything we do is about helping people feel connected and closer, and we are proud of our unique company culture.

         We had a global workforce of 67,317 employees as of December 31, 2023, and we have offices in approximately 90 cities around the world. We are
committed to fostering an enriching environment for our workforce and we are focused on supporting our people in doing the best work of their careers. We
offer competitive compensation and a wide range of benefits, including many learning and development resources, and we work to build a diverse and
inclusive workplace.

         Beginning in November 2022, we took a number of steps to reduce our expense base. For example, our cost reduction efforts have included scaling back
budgets, reducing company perks, shrinking our real estate footprint, and employee layoffs and restructurings. We make it a priority to treat outgoing
employees with respect and provide a generous severance package. For U.S. employees, that includes severance of 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional
weeks for every year of service, payment for all remaining paid time off, restricted stock unit vesting through their last day on payroll, health insurance,
coverage of the cost of healthcare for employees and their families for six months, career services that included three months of career support with an external
vendor and early access to unpublished job leads, immigration support that included dedicated immigration specialists to help guide employees based on their
needs. We offer similar support for outgoing employees outside of the United States while taking into account local employment laws.

         Employee Learning and Development

         We value our investment in growing and keeping a highly skilled workforce. We aim to provide all of our employees with regular performance reviews
twice a year as we believe it is an important part of how we support their growth and career development while also recognizing and rewarding their impact at
Meta. We also offer career development opportunities and work experience programs that extend beyond the physical and virtual classroom. To do this, we
utilize various learning modalities, such as live virtual and in-person learning experiences, on-demand e-learning, self-service resources, learning communities,
and coaching engagements.

To aid in this effort, we have taken steps to reduce
bias from our hiring processes and performance management systems, as well as offering learning and development courses for our employees.

insurance_documents, What challenges might Tesla face if they inaccurately forecast demand for their vehicles and energy products?,"We may be unable to grow our global product sales, delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle charging
        networks, or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth.
        Our success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities. We are targeting a global mass demographic with a broad range
of potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products. We currently produce numerous
international variants at a limited number of factories, and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to
timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a
given region. Likewise, as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast
demand in various markets.

        Because we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers. As our production
volumes continue to grow, we have faced in the past, and may face challenges with deliveries at increasing volumes, particularly in international markets
requiring significant transit times. We have also deployed a number of delivery models, such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces and
touchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or be accepted globally. Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we
are working to substantially increase our production and installation capabilities. If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand, our
business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.

        Moreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized
professionals. If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability
of our vehicles, particularly higher-volume additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y, it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts
inventory. Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and
connectors throughout the world.

Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand, growth,
prospects and operating results.

        Our future growth and success are dependent upon consumers’ demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an
        automotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile.
        Though we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in
particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles
compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.

        In addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our vehicles could be negatively
affected by numerous factors, such as:

        •     perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;
        •     perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to charging facilities;

        •     competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion
             engine vehicles;
        •     volatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy;

        •     government regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and

        •     concerns about our future viability.

          The target demographics for our vehicles are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets,
which may expose us to further volatility. We also cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact on consumer
demand. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and
attempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly.
Rising interest rates may lead to consumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which may harm our demand, business and
operating results. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate
with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results
may be harmed.

        We face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.","If Tesla inaccurately forecasts demand for their vehicles and energy products, they may face several challenges, including:

1. **Inability to Grow Sales and Delivery Capabilities**: Inaccurate demand projections could hinder Tesla's ability to expand their global product sales, delivery, and installation capabilities, as well as their servicing and vehicle charging networks.

2. **Production and Delivery Issues**: If demand expectations for specific vehicle variants are incorrect, Tesla may struggle to generate timely deliveries that align with their production schedules, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies.

3. **Challenges in Energy Product Growth**: As Tesla develops its energy products and services, incorrect demand forecasts could negatively impact their success in various markets.

4. **Delivery Model Scalability**: Tesla's innovative delivery models, such as home and touchless deliveries, may not be scalable or accepted globally, especially if production volumes increase without accurate demand forecasting.

5. **Servicing Capacity Strain**: Delays in adding servicing capacity or addressing reliability issues with their vehicles could overwhelm their servicing capabilities, particularly with higher-volume models like the Model 3 and Model Y.

6. **Brand and Financial Impact**: Failing to meet demand or implementing product price increases could harm Tesla's brand, growth prospects, and overall operating results.

7. **Market Volatility**: The automotive industry is competitive and cyclical, and if the market for electric vehicles does not develop as expected, Tesla's business and financial condition may suffer.

8. **External Market Factors**: Factors such as consumer perceptions, competition, oil price volatility, government regulations, and economic conditions could further impact demand for Tesla's products.

Overall, these challenges could significantly affect Tesla's business operations, financial health, and growth trajectory.",NASDAQ_TSLA_2023.pdf_31 and NASDAQ_TSLA_2023.pdf_34,2024-09-20 17:06:14

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

        You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our
business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company.

And we want to make sure everyone who
works at our company feels welcome.
We want to articulate how we weigh in on
social issues and what it means for our
customers.
Before I comment about culture issues, I have a
confession to make: I am a full-throated, red-
blooded, patriotic, free-enterprise (properly regu-
lated, of course) and free-market capitalist. Our
company is frequently asked to take a position on
an issue, rule or legislation that might be consid-
ered “cultural.” When that happens, we take a
deep breath and study the matter. Many of the
laws in question have many specific requirements,
some of which you would agree with but not oth-
ers. But we are being asked to support the entire
law. In cases like these, we simply make our own
statement that reflects our educated view and val-
ues; however, we do not give our voice to others.
We believe in the values of democracy, including
freedom of speech and expression, and are
staunchly against discrimination and hate. We
have not turned away — and will not turn away —
customers because of their political or religious
affiliations nor would we tell customers how they
should spend their money.
Our commitment to these ideals is also reflected in
our employees. The talent at our firm is a vibrant
mix of cultures, beliefs and backgrounds. We are,
of course, fully committed to freedom of speech.
There are things that you can say that would be
permitted under freedom of speech but would not
be allowed under our Code of Conduct. For exam-
ple, we do not allow intimidation, threats or highly
prejudicial behavior or speech. Our Code of Con-
duct clearly stipulates that certain statements and
behavior, while allowed under freedom of speech,
can lead to disciplinary action at our company —
from being reprimanded to being fired.





                                                      UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY  25             WHAT WE LEARNED: A FIVE-POINT ACTION PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD
            ON THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE

In May 2023, we gathered with knowledgeable and influential
people from the energy industry writ large to the government
and financial services arena in Scottsdale, Arizona, for an
action forum.

These programs aim to convert
             high-performing individuals to full-time roles and create a veteran talent pipeline.

        •     Apprenticeships – Tesla Apprenticeships are offered globally, providing academic and on-the-job training to prepare specialists in skilled
             trades. Apprentices will complete between one to four years of on-the-job training. Apprentice programs have seen skilled trade hires across the
             U.S., Australia, Hong Kong, Korea and Germany.

        •     Manufacturing Development Program – Tesla's manufacturing pathway program is designed to provide graduating high school seniors with
             the financial resources, coursework and experience they need to start a successful manufacturing career at Tesla. We hired 373 graduates
             through this program in 2023, and our goal in 2024 is grow this program to over 600 students annually across our Fremont Factory, Gigafactory
             Nevada, Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory New York.

                                                                                                    13 Table of Contents

        •     Engineering Development Program – Launched in January 2024, this program targets recent college and university graduates for specialized
             engineering fields. In collaboration with Austin Community College, the program educates early-career engineers in controls engineering,
             enhancing their knowledge of high-demand technologies for U.S. manufacturing.

        We will continue to expand the opportunities for our employees to add skills and develop professionally with a new Employee Educational Assistance
Program launching in the U.S. in the spring of 2024 to help employees pursue select certificates or degrees. With virtual, self-paced education options
available, employees can pursue a new path or expand their knowledge while continuing to grow their career.

        At Tesla, our employees show up passionate about making a difference in the world and for each other. We remain unwavering in our demand that
our factories, offices, stores and service centers are places where our employees feel respected and appreciated. Our policies are designed to promote
fairness and respect for everyone. We hire, evaluate and promote employees based on their skills and performance. Everyone is expected to be
trustworthy, demonstrate excellence in their performance and collaborate with others. With this in mind, we will not tolerate certain behaviors. These
include harassment, retaliation, violence, intimidation and discrimination of any kind on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual
orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, disability or veteran status.

If Tesla inaccurately forecasts demand for their vehicles and energy products, they may face several challenges, including:

1. **Inability to Grow Sales and Delivery Capabilities**: Inaccurate demand projections could hinder Tesla's ability to expand their global product sales, delivery, and installation capabilities, as well as their servicing and vehicle charging networks.

2. **Production and Delivery Issues**: If demand expectations for specific vehicle variants are incorrect, Tesla may struggle to generate timely deliveries that align with their production schedules, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies.

3. **Challenges in Energy Product Growth**: As Tesla develops its energy products and services, incorrect demand forecasts could negatively impact their success in various markets.

4. **Delivery Model Scalability**: Tesla's innovative delivery models, such as home and touchless deliveries, may not be scalable or accepted globally, especially if production volumes increase without accurate demand forecasting.

5. **Servicing Capacity Strain**: Delays in adding servicing capacity or addressing reliability issues with their vehicles could overwhelm their servicing capabilities, particularly with higher-volume models like the Model 3 and Model Y.

6. **Brand and Financial Impact**: Failing to meet demand or implementing product price increases could harm Tesla's brand, growth prospects, and overall operating results.

7. **Market Volatility**: The automotive industry is competitive and cyclical, and if the market for electric vehicles does not develop as expected, Tesla's business and financial condition may suffer.

8. **External Market Factors**: Factors such as consumer perceptions, competition, oil price volatility, government regulations, and economic conditions could further impact demand for Tesla's products.

Overall, these challenges could significantly affect Tesla's business operations, financial health, and growth trajectory.","The behaviors that are not tolerated by the company include harassment, retaliation, violence, intimidation, and discrimination of any kind based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, disability, or veteran status.",NASDAQ_TSLA_2023.pdf_26 and NYSE_JPM_2023.pdf_55 and NASDAQ_TSLA_2023.pdf_25,2024-09-20 17:06:57

Human Capital Resources

        A competitive edge for Tesla is its ability to attract and retain high quality employees. During the past year, Tesla made substantial investments in
its workforce, further strengthening its standing as one of the most desirable and innovative companies to work for. As of December 31, 2023, our
employee headcount worldwide was 140,473.

        We have created an environment that fosters growth opportunities, and as of this report, nearly two-thirds (65%) of our managers were promoted
from an internal, non-manager position, and 43% of our management employees have been with Tesla for more than five years. Tesla’s growth of 35%
over the past two years has offered internal career development to our employees as well as the ability to make a meaningful contribution to a
sustainable future.

        We are able to retain our employees, in part, not only because employees can enjoy ownership in Tesla through stock (of which 89% have been
given the opportunity to), but because we also provide them with excellent health benefits such as free counseling, paid parental leave, paid time off and
zero-premium medical plan options that are made available on the first day of employment.

possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and
defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for
infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this
pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other

ESG
        The very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot reduce carbon
emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation
ecosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one,
including with respect to per-unit waste reduction and resource consumption, including water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing
sustainability of operations outside of our direct control, including reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.

        We are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that
ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing
into their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and
external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our
incidents per vehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering compelling,
impactful jobs with best in-industry benefits.

and other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD and neural
network capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings.

Energy Generation and Storage

        Energy Storage Systems
        The market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are
similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy density
and efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage
products give us a competitive advantage in our markets.

        Solar Energy Systems
        The primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We
compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our
solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies
only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with
our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.

Intellectual Property

        We place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio.
As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents,
trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidential information and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure
agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest
possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and
defend our product portfolio.

We believe this infrastructure
enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more
affordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.

        We reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales channels. However, sales
of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.

                                                                                                     6 Table of Contents

        Used Vehicle Sales
        Our used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer’s existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of
a new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third
parties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns.

        Public Charging

        We have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-
locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically
placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an
extensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In
November 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s
transition to sustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American Charging
Standard (NACS). This enables all electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate — which makes charging easier and more efficient for everyone
and advances our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Following this, a number of major automotive companies announced
their adoption of NACS, with their access to the Supercharger network beginning in phases in 2024 and their production of NACS vehicles beginning no
later than 2025. We also engaged SAE International to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400.

        Solar Energy—General
        We are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity. To operate our
systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties,
such as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.

        Solar Energy—Net Metering
        Most states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to
interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated
by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available
under net metering or have proposed to do so.

Competition

Automotive
        The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as a significant and
growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter the
electric vehicle market.

        We believe that our vehicles compete in the market based on both their traditional segment classification as well as their propulsion technology. For
example, Cybertruck competes with other pickup trucks, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3
and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, which are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically
include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers
have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and
vehicle introductions, including the introduction of electric vehicles into rental car company fleets, promote the development of the electric vehicle
market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers have
electric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are
also developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.

This is not about JPMorgan Chase — we believe we
can manage through whatever is thrown our way.
This is about the impact on all parts of the system
— from smaller banks to larger regional banks that
may not have the resources to handle all of these
regulatory requirements. It’s also about the effect
on the financial markets and the economy from the
rapidly growing shadow banking system, as well as
the ultimate impact on the customers, clients and
communities we serve. This is about what’s right
for the system.

The banking and financial system is
innovative, dynamic and constantly changing.
The banking system is not static: There are startup
banks, mergers, successful upstarts and fintech
banks, and even Apple, which effectively acts as a
bank — it holds money, moves money, lends money
and so on. Nonbanks are competing with tradi-
tional banks, and, in general, this dynamism and
churn are good for innovation and invention — with
success and failure simply part of the robust pro-
cess. Innovation runs across payments systems,
budgeting, digital access, product extensions, risk
and fraud prevention, and other services. Different
institutions play different roles, and, importantly,

small banks and big banks serve completely differ-
ent strategic functions. Large banks bank multina-
tional corporations around the world, make
healthy markets, and wield technology and a prod-
uct set that are the best in the world. A small bank
simply cannot bank these same multinational gov-
ernments and safely move the amount of money
and securities that large banks do. Regional and
community banks have exceptional local knowl-
edge and presence and are critical in serving
thousands of towns and certain geographies.
It is also important to recognize that the banking
system as we know it is shrinking relative to pri-
vate markets and fintech, which are growing and
becoming increasingly competitive. And remember
that many of these new players do not have the
same transparency or need to abide by the exten-
sive rules and regulations as traditional banks,
even if they offer similar products — this often
gives them significant advantage.
To deal with this fluid environment, banks of all
sizes develop their own strategies, whether to
specialize, expand geographically or embark on
mergers and acquisitions.

Risks Related to Government Laws and Regulations

        Demand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the
        development and adoption of such products.
        Government and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax
exemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated, amended or exhausted from time to time. For example, previously available incentives
favoring electric vehicles in certain areas have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not eventually replaced or
reinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales. In addition, certain government and economic incentives may also be implemented or amended
to provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla. Such
developments could negatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them, including through pricing
modifications.

        In addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy
storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds.
However, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase,
sometimes without warning. Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy
that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has been

        Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
        In the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers
and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile
manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or perform
warranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state.
In certain such states, we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur.

        Some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative
processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively
lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our
own retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts.

        Battery Safety and Testing
        Our battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-
ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations.

        We use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and disposal of our battery
packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future. We have
agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs, and we are also piloting our own recycling technology.

        Solar Energy—General
        We are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity. To operate our
systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities.

We could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain
        governmental investigations and proceedings.
        We are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15,                              Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has
concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility
that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any
other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information
and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.

        We may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.
        While we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our
vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales
model. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such
assertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations
and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such
results have reinforced our continuing belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers
anywhere in the world. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted,
would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability
to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. The application of state laws applicable
to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.

The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain
information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel
economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and New Car
Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.

        Our vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those
regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the
rollout of new vehicle features.

        Self-Driving Vehicles
        Generally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features or vehicle designs
that we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has
published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and manufacturer reporting obligations, and retains the authority to
investigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have
legal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory
patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.

        In markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (“ECE markets”), some requirements restrict the
design of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicable laws, both current and
proposed, may hinder the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply.

        Other key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ materially from the U.S.
and ECE markets, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features.

warranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state.
In certain such states, we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur.

        Some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative
processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively
lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our
own retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts.

        Battery Safety and Testing
        Our battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-
ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations.

        We use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and disposal of our battery
packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future. We have
agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs, and we are also piloting our own recycling technology.

        Solar Energy—General
        We are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity. To operate our
systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities.

We could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain
        governmental investigations and proceedings.
        We are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15,                              Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has
concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility
that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any
other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information
and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.

        We may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.
        While we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our
vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales
model. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such
assertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations
and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such
results have reinforced our continuing belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers
anywhere in the world. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted,
would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability
to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. The application of state laws applicable
to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.

The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain
information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel
economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and New Car
Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.

        Our vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those
regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the
rollout of new vehicle features.

        Self-Driving Vehicles
        Generally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features or vehicle designs
that we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has
published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and manufacturer reporting obligations, and retains the authority to
investigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have
legal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory
patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.

        In markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (“ECE markets”), some requirements restrict the
design of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicable laws, both current and
proposed, may hinder the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply.

        Other key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ materially from the U.S.
and ECE markets, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features.

        Solar Energy System Incentives and Policies
        U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy
and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates.

        In particular, pursuant to the IRA, Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the IRC provides a tax credit between 6% and 70% of qualified commercial or
residential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase, or by us for arrangements where
we own the systems for properties that meet statutory requirements. These tax credits are primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and are
currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.

Regulations
        Vehicle Safety and Testing
        In the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including all applicable Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness and
occupant protection requirements. Our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable
FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, however, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles
meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.

        We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, Theft
Prevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements
regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, a Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes
involving vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems, and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety
investigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain
information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel
economy ratings, as determined by the U.S.

insurance_documents, What measures does the company take to minimize potential production risks due to disruptions in the supply of key components?,"For example, a global shortage of semiconductors beginning in early 2021 has caused challenges in the manufacturing
industry and impacted our supply chain and production. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if
they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and
require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities,
product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity
expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes
by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may
face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or
require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may
experience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure
additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly
or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid
unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce,
especially in the case of increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating
results.

        As the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high
volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of
component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the
increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off
costs, which may harm our business and operating results.

Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.
Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many
components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing
fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor
industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of
components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into
agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or
at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular
industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or
regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional
economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,”
above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price
increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial
capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these
components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common
components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product
has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business,
results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Energy Generation and Storage

        We offer certain financing options to our solar customers, which enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system, Solar Roof or
integrated solar and Powerwall system. Our solar PPAs, offered primarily to commercial customers, charge a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of
electricity produced by our solar energy systems.

Manufacturing
        We currently have manufacturing facilities in the U.S. in Northern California, in Buffalo, New York, Gigafactory New York; in Austin, Texas,
Gigafactory Texas and near Reno, Nevada, Gigafactory Nevada. At these facilities, we manufacture and assemble, among other things, vehicles, certain
vehicle parts and components, such as our battery packs and battery cells, energy storage components and solar products and components.

        Internationally, we also have manufacturing facilities in China (Gigafactory Shanghai) and Germany (Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg), which allows
us to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the
impact of unfavorable tariffs. In March 2023, we announced the location of our next Gigafactory in Monterrey, Mexico. Generally, we continue to expand
production capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding
local manufacturing.

Supply Chain
        Our products use thousands of parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with
vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or
are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.

                                                                                                     8 Table of Contents

        As is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple
sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize
potential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks
for components with lengthy procurement lead times.

        Our products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper.

execute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to
raw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.

Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations

        Globally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies. Our business and
products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.

        The operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note 2,Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.

Programs and Incentives
        Inflation Reduction Act
        On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December
31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and
energy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up
to $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.

        Automotive Regulatory Credits
        We earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”), greenhouse gas, fuel
economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory
requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated statements of operations included
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Energy Generation and Storage

        We offer certain financing options to our solar customers, which enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system, Solar Roof or
integrated solar and Powerwall system. Our solar PPAs, offered primarily to commercial customers, charge a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of
electricity produced by our solar energy systems.

Manufacturing
        We currently have manufacturing facilities in the U.S. in Northern California, in Buffalo, New York, Gigafactory New York; in Austin, Texas,
Gigafactory Texas and near Reno, Nevada, Gigafactory Nevada. At these facilities, we manufacture and assemble, among other things, vehicles, certain
vehicle parts and components, such as our battery packs and battery cells, energy storage components and solar products and components.

        Internationally, we also have manufacturing facilities in China (Gigafactory Shanghai) and Germany (Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg), which allows
us to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the
impact of unfavorable tariffs. In March 2023, we announced the location of our next Gigafactory in Monterrey, Mexico. Generally, we continue to expand
production capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding
local manufacturing.

Supply Chain
        Our products use thousands of parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with
vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or
are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.

                                                                                                     8 Table of Contents

        As is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple
sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize
potential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks
for components with lengthy procurement lead times.

        Our products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper.

Operations are currently divided into three
business units: grocery distribution, foodservice distribution and beverage distribution.
        McLane’s grocery distribution unit, based in Temple, Texas, maintains a dominant market share within the convenience
store industry and serves most of the national convenience store chains and major oil company retail outlets. Grocery operations

enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more
affordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.

        We reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales channels. However, sales
of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.

                                                                                                     6 Table of Contents

        Used Vehicle Sales
        Our used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer’s existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of
a new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third
parties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns.

        Public Charging

        We have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-
locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically
placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an
extensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In
November 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s
transition to sustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American Charging
Standard (NACS). This enables all electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate — which makes charging easier and more efficient for everyone
and advances our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Following this, a number of major automotive companies announced
their adoption of NACS, with their access to the Supercharger network beginning in phases in 2024 and their production of NACS vehicles beginning no
later than 2025. We also engaged SAE International to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400.

        We also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional
charging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities, to deploy home charging solutions.

        In-App Upgrades
        As our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the
Tesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a
subscription basis in the future.

Energy Generation and Storage

        We market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of
channels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel partners, and in the case of some commercial
customers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt
clean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.

Service and Warranty

insurance_documents,What are the different consumer vehicles currently manufactured by the company and what are their key characteristics?,"Our Products and Services

Automotive
        We currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles – the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we
designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle (“SUV”) built on the Model 3 platform
with seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and
Model X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we
entered the consumer pickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has
the utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.

        In 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned electric vehicles to
address additional vehicle markets, and to continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving (“FSD”) Capability features, battery cell
and other technologies.

Energy Generation and Storage
        Energy Storage Products
        Powerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to customers, as well as through
channel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial,
utility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (“GWh”) or greater
capacity.

        We also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a wide range of
markets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.

                                                                                                     4 Table of Contents

        Solar Energy Offerings
        We sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners and also make them available through power purchase agreement (“PPA”)
arrangements. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and
adequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products.

        We sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, directly to customers, as well as through channel
customers.

Many major automobile manufacturers have
electric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are
also developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.

                                                                                                     11 Table of Contents

        We believe that there is also increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving technologies, charging solutions
and other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD and neural
network capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings.

Energy Generation and Storage

        Energy Storage Systems
        The market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are
similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy density
and efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage
products give us a competitive advantage in our markets.

        Solar Energy Systems
        The primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We
compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our
solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies
only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with
our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.

Intellectual Property

        We place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio.
As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents,
trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidential information and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure
agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest
possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and
defend our product portfolio.

The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain
information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel
economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and New Car
Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.

        Our vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those
regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the
rollout of new vehicle features.

        Self-Driving Vehicles
        Generally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features or vehicle designs
that we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has
published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and manufacturer reporting obligations, and retains the authority to
investigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have
legal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory
patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.

        In markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (“ECE markets”), some requirements restrict the
design of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicable laws, both current and
proposed, may hinder the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply.

        Other key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ materially from the U.S.
and ECE markets, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features.

                                                                                                     10 Table of Contents

        Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
        In the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers
and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents.

        Retailing Businesses
        Berkshire’s retailing businesses include automotive, home furnishings and several other operations that sell various
consumer products and services. Berkshire’s retailing businesses employed approximately 26,000 people at the end of 2023.
Information regarding each of these operations follows.
        Berkshire Hathaway Automotive
        Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”) is one of the largest automotive retailers in the U.S., currently operating
108 new vehicle franchises through 83 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in the U.S. The dealerships
sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products
and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers through third-party lenders. BHA operates 31
collision centers directly connected to the dealerships’ operations and owns and operates two auto auctions and an automotive
fluid maintenance products distributor.
        Dealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 75% of dealership-
related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle
manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln,
Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. These manufacturers represent approximately 90% of the revenue generated by
BHA’s dealerships.
        The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private
dealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the retail price
transparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same
terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key
differentiators in attracting customers.

                                                                              K-22         BHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework
agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and ownership structure of BHA’s
dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA’s ability to acquire additional
dealerships representing those manufacturers.

       This   Annual    Report    on   Form    10-K   contains     forward-looking      statements     within   the   meaning     of  the   U.S.

All statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K other than
statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our
objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words ""believe,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""estimate,"" ""continue,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""expect,""
and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current
expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-
term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties
and assumptions, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive
and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact
of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in
any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking
statements.

        We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given
these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward‑looking statements.

        Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms ""Meta,"" ""company,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" and ""our"" in this document refer to Meta
Platforms, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. The term ""Family"" refers to our Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and
WhatsApp products. For references to accessing Meta's products on the ""web"" or via a ""website,"" such terms refer to accessing such products on personal
computers.

These statements, which are identified by terms such as ""anticipates,"" ""believes,"" ""estimates,"" and ""expects,"" are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.

insurance_documents,Why should investors not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements? ,"Forward-looking statements inherently involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on
management's current plans and expectations, expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable
basis. However, we can give no assurance that any expectation or belief will result or will be achieved or
accomplished. Investors therefore should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The
following include some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ from those
anticipated:
•    the significant costs and uncertainties in the pharmaceutical research and development process, including
     with respect to the timing and process of obtaining regulatory approvals;
•    the impact and uncertain outcome of acquisitions and business development transactions and related
     costs;
•    intense competition affecting our products, pipeline or industry;
•    market uptake of launched products and indications;
•    continued pricing pressures and the impact of actions of governmental and private payers affecting
     pricing of, reimbursement for, and patient access to pharmaceuticals, or reporting obligations related
     thereto;
•    safety or efficacy concerns associated with our products;
•    dependence on relatively few products or product classes for a significant percentage of our total revenue
     and an increasingly consolidated supply chain;
•    the expiration of intellectual property protection for certain of our products and competition from generic
     and biosimilar products, and risks from the proliferation of counterfeit or illegally compounded products;
•    our ability to protect and enforce patents and other intellectual property and changes in patent law or
     regulations related to data package exclusivity;
•    information technology system inadequacies, inadequate controls or procedures, security breaches, or
     operating failures;
•    unauthorized access, disclosure, misappropriation, or compromise of confidential information or other
     data stored in our information technology systems, networks, and facilities, or those of third parties with
     whom we share our data and violations of data protection laws or regulations;
•    issues with product supply and regulatory approvals stemming from manufacturing difficulties, disruptions,
     or shortages, including as a result of unpredictability and variability in demand, labor shortages, third-
     party performance, quality, cyber-attacks, or regulatory actions related to our and third-party facilities;
•    reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements;

The significance of forward-looking statements in the context of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K lies in their role in providing insights into the company's expectations regarding future financial performance, business strategies, and operational objectives.

Item 1.               Business
Eli Lilly and Company (referred to as the company, Lilly, we, or us) was incorporated in 1901 in Indiana to
succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. We
discover, develop, manufacture, and market products in a single business segment—human pharmaceutical
products.
Our purpose is to unite caring with discovery to create medicines that make life better for people around the
world. Most of the products that we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists, and our long-
term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative
medicines.
We manufacture and distribute our products through facilities in the United States (U.S.), including Puerto Rico,
and in Europe and Asia. Our products are sold in approximately 105 countries.

insurance_documents,What factors have intensified governmental scrutiny of the pharmaceutical industry's operations?,"State, federal, and foreign governments,
agencies, and other regulatory bodies are active in their oversight, enforcement activities, and coordination with
respect to pharmaceutical companies, which has resulted in intensified scrutiny, litigation costs, corporate
criminal sanctions, and substantial civil settlements in the pharmaceutical industry.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits certain individuals and entities, including U.S.
publicly traded companies, from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt
intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain
any improper advantage. The FCPA also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on
U.S. publicly traded companies. As noted above, our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves
significant interaction with officials outside the U.S. Additionally, in many countries outside the U.S., healthcare
providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and purchasers of pharmaceuticals
are government entities; therefore, our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to
regulation under the FCPA.
In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, the various jurisdictions in which we operate
and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and
anticompetitive behavior. In recent years, several jurisdictions have enhanced their laws and regulations in this
area, increased their enforcement activities, and/or increased the level of cross-border coordination and
information sharing.
We are, and could in the future become, subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which
could include claims for civil penalties (including treble damages), criminal sanctions, and administrative
remedies, including exclusion from U.S. federal and other healthcare programs. It is possible that an adverse
outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,
liquidity, and financial position in any given period.
We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety, and other
laws and regulations that may affect our research, development, or production efforts.

                                                                          15 Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access
U.S.
There continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing. In addition, U.S.

We continue to face intense competition for qualified
   individuals from numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic
   and other research institutions, as well as employers near our manufacturing and other facilities, which
   has and may continue to increase our labor costs. Our ability to attract and retain talent in our increasingly
   competitive environment is further complicated by evolving employment trends. Our failure to compete
   effectively for talent could negatively affect sales of our current and any future approved products and
   indications, and could result in material financial, legal, commercial, or reputational harm to our business.

                                                                    25 •  Our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private
   restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs, which could have a material
   adverse effect on our results of operations, reputation or business.
   Public and private payers continue to take aggressive steps to control their expenditures for
   pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for, and patient access to, our
   medicines. These pressures have negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, our
   consolidated results of operations. Governments and private payers worldwide have intensified their
   scrutiny of, and actions intended to address, pricing, reimbursement, and access to pharmaceutical
   products and are demanding greater commercial and clinical value from pharmaceutical companies in the
   form of strong product differentiation and demonstrated value. We have experienced increased scrutiny
   on the pricing of current and potential diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer's products due to payer concern
   over projected growth in these markets and, for certain of these drugs, the anticipated duration of
   treatment. We have also observed scrutiny of pricing and access disparities across jurisdictions.
   Additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including because of the regulatory priorities
   of the U.S. presidential administration and regulatory authorities worldwide, could adversely impact our
   business and consolidated results of operations. For example, in August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance,
   which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to
   government-set prices effective in 2026. Given our product portfolio, we expect additional significant
   products will be selected in future years, which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion
   prior to exclusivity expiry.

A comment
period on the proposal runs through February 6, 2024, and we are not able to predict whether a final rule will be
adopted in accordance with the proposed framework.
Outside the U.S., the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary
widely. In recent years, we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in
many countries outside the U.S.
For more information on patent challenges and litigation involving our intellectual property rights, see Item 1A,
""Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our long-term success depends on intellectual property
protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated, circumvented, or weakened, our business will be
adversely affected."" and Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16: Contingencies.""

                                                                         13 Government Regulation of Our Operations
Our operations are regulated extensively by numerous government agencies.
Regulation of Products
The lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing, data analysis, manufacturing development, and regulatory
review necessary for governmental approvals of our products is extremely costly and can significantly delay
product introductions and revenue generation. In addition, our operations are subject to complex federal, state,
local, and foreign laws and regulations concerning relationships with healthcare providers and suppliers, pricing
and reimbursement for our products, the environment, occupational health and safety, data privacy and security,
and other matters. Evolving regulatory priorities have intensified governmental scrutiny of our operations and
those of other healthcare intermediaries, including with respect to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP),
quality assurance, and similar regulations. Regulatory oversight of the pharmaceutical industry entails judgment
and interpretation, which can result in inconsistent administration of laws and regulations by health authorities.
Compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the
discovery, development, and introduction of new products and uses has and will continue to require substantial
effort, expense, and capital investment.
Of particular importance to our business is regulation by the FDA in the U.S. Pursuant to laws and regulations
that include the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the FDA has jurisdiction over all of our products
and devices in the U.S. and administers requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing,
quality control, distribution, labeling, marketing, promotion, advertising, dissemination of information, and post-
marketing surveillance of those products and devices.

Further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the
      Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could
      influence tax laws in countries in which we operate, such as the recent enactments by both the EU and
      non-EU countries of a global minimum tax. Modifications to key elements of the U.S. or international tax
      framework could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows.
      See Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Tax Matters""
      and Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 14: Income Taxes,"" for more details.
•     Regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company.
      The marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the
      manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to
      extensive scrutiny and regulation. Many companies, including us, are and have been subject to
      investigations, litigation, and claims related to these practices asserted by governmental authorities and

                                                                        34 other parties. These investigations, litigation, and claims have resulted in substantial expense and other
significant consequences. The final outcomes of such investigations, litigation, and claims include criminal
charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or non-monetary remedies, including exclusion from U.S.
federal and other healthcare programs. Such investigations, litigation, and claims have intensified and
may continue to intensify as a result of evolving U.S. and foreign regulatory priorities. New business
practices or commercial capabilities may subject us to additional scrutiny over compliance with applicable
regulatory schemes and compliance obligations or expose us to new regulatory schemes and compliance
obligations entirely. In addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with cGMP, quality assurance,
evolving standards, and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as
nitrosamines, and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards)
for our products in some cases lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines
and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import
certifications, delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of
current products pending resolution of the issues, and reputational harm, any of which adversely affects
our business.","Governmental scrutiny of the pharmaceutical industry's operations has intensified due to several factors:

1. **Increased Regulatory Oversight**: State, federal, and foreign governments, along with various regulatory bodies, are actively overseeing pharmaceutical companies, leading to heightened scrutiny, litigation costs, and corporate sanctions.

2. **Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)**: The FCPA prohibits certain actions by U.S. publicly traded companies regarding foreign officials, imposing strict recordkeeping and internal controls, which adds to the regulatory burden.

3. **Enhanced Laws and Regulations**: Many jurisdictions have strengthened their laws against corrupt and anticompetitive behavior, increasing enforcement activities and cross-border coordination.

4. **Public and Private Payer Scrutiny**: There is considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, with payers demanding greater value from pharmaceutical companies, particularly concerning pricing and access to medications.

5. **Regulatory Compliance Challenges**: The complex regulatory environment, including compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and evolving standards, has led to increased scrutiny and potential legal actions.

6. **Litigation and Investigations**: Pharmaceutical companies face ongoing investigations and litigation related to marketing, pricing practices, and interactions with healthcare providers, which can result in significant penalties and reputational harm.

These factors collectively contribute to a more challenging regulatory landscape for the pharmaceutical industry.",NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_28 and NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_51 and NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_24 and NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_74,2024-09-20 17:36:32

U.S.
There continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing. In addition, U.S.

Further, cost inflation and global transportation and logistics
   challenges, as well as tight labor markets, have caused, and in the future may cause, delays in, and/or
   increase costs related to, distribution of our medicines, the construction or other acquisition of additional
   manufacturing capacity, procurement activity, and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements. These
   disruptions and challenges could result from actual or perceived quality, oversight, or regulatory
   compliance problems; natural disasters (including increased instances or severity of natural disasters or
   other events that may be due to climate change), public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics;
   periods of uneven economic growth or downturns; emergence or escalation of, and responses to
   international tension and conflicts; equipment, mechanical, data, or IT system vulnerabilities, such as
   system inadequacies, inadequate controls or procedures, operating failures, unauthorized access, service
   interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, theft, exfiltration, ransomware or other
   cyber-attacks from a variety of sources; labor shortages; challenges and complexities in manufacturing
   new drug modalities; contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; vertical
   integration by competitors within our supply chain; or inability to obtain single-source or other raw or
   intermediate materials. Regional or single source dependencies may in some cases accentuate risks
   related to manufacturing and supply. For example, we, and the pharmaceutical industry generally, depend
   on China-based partners for integral chemical synthesis, reagents, starting materials, and ingredients.
   Finding alternative suppliers if and as necessary due to geopolitical developments or otherwise may not
   be feasible or could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of
   our products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals which would cause disruptions to patients and
   detrimentally impact our business.
   Difficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products and those of our competitors and the very
   long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing
   capacity have resulted, and in the future may result, in difficulty meeting demand, or disruptions,
   shortages, and higher costs in the supply of, our products. For example, we have experienced challenges

                                                                      31    in meeting demand for our incretin products in recent periods, partially due to the limited availability of
   competitor therapies, and expect tight supply to persist while additional manufacturing capacity is
   operationalized.

and interpretation, which can result in inconsistent administration of laws and regulations by health authorities.
Compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the
discovery, development, and introduction of new products and uses has and will continue to require substantial
effort, expense, and capital investment.
Of particular importance to our business is regulation by the FDA in the U.S. Pursuant to laws and regulations
that include the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the FDA has jurisdiction over all of our products
and devices in the U.S. and administers requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing,
quality control, distribution, labeling, marketing, promotion, advertising, dissemination of information, and post-
marketing surveillance of those products and devices.

Further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the
      Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could
      influence tax laws in countries in which we operate, such as the recent enactments by both the EU and
      non-EU countries of a global minimum tax. Modifications to key elements of the U.S. or international tax
      framework could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows.

      and Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 14: Income Taxes,"" for more details.
•     Regulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company.
      The marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the
      manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to
      extensive scrutiny and regulation. Many companies, including us, are and have been subject to
      investigations, litigation, and claims related to these practices asserted by governmental authorities and

                                                                        34 other parties. These investigations, litigation, and claims have resulted in substantial expense and other
significant consequences. The final outcomes of such investigations, litigation, and claims include criminal
charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or non-monetary remedies, including exclusion from U.S.
federal and other healthcare programs. Such investigations, litigation, and claims have intensified and
may continue to intensify as a result of evolving U.S. and foreign regulatory priorities. New business
practices or commercial capabilities may subject us to additional scrutiny over compliance with applicable
regulatory schemes and compliance obligations or expose us to new regulatory schemes and compliance
obligations entirely. In addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with cGMP, quality assurance,
evolving standards, and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as
nitrosamines, and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards)
for our products in some cases lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines
and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import
certifications, delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of
current products pending resolution of the issues, and reputational harm, any of which adversely affects
our business.

Governmental scrutiny of the pharmaceutical industry's operations has intensified due to several factors:

1. **Increased Regulatory Oversight**: State, federal, and foreign governments, along with various regulatory bodies, are actively overseeing pharmaceutical companies, leading to heightened scrutiny, litigation costs, and corporate sanctions.

2. **Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)**: The FCPA prohibits certain actions by U.S. publicly traded companies regarding foreign officials, imposing strict recordkeeping and internal controls, which adds to the regulatory burden.

3. **Enhanced Laws and Regulations**: Many jurisdictions have strengthened their laws against corrupt and anticompetitive behavior, increasing enforcement activities and cross-border coordination.

4. **Public and Private Payer Scrutiny**: There is considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, with payers demanding greater value from pharmaceutical companies, particularly concerning pricing and access to medications.

5. **Regulatory Compliance Challenges**: The complex regulatory environment, including compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and evolving standards, has led to increased scrutiny and potential legal actions.

6. **Litigation and Investigations**: Pharmaceutical companies face ongoing investigations and litigation related to marketing, pricing practices, and interactions with healthcare providers, which can result in significant penalties and reputational harm.

These factors collectively contribute to a more challenging regulatory landscape for the pharmaceutical industry.","Governmental scrutiny of the pharmaceutical industry's operations has intensified due to several factors:

insurance_documents, What is the earliest time a prospective biosimilar competitor can challenge the validity of an innovator's patents under the BPCIA?,"In
addition, generic companies have shown willingness to launch ""at risk,"" i.e., after receiving ANDA approval but
before final resolution of their patent challenge.
Under the BPCIA, the FDA cannot approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires,
12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic, and an application may not be submitted until
four years following the date the innovator biologic was first approved. However, the BPCIA does provide a
mechanism for a prospective biosimilar competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator's patents as early as
four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic.
The patent litigation scheme under the BPCIA, and the BPCIA itself, is complex and continues to be interpreted
and implemented by the FDA, as well as by courts. Courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required
to engage in the BPCIA patent litigation scheme and patent holders retain the right to bring suit under normal
patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration. In
addition, there is a procedure in U.S. patent law, known as inter partes review (IPR), which allows any member of
the public to file a petition with the USPTO seeking the review of any issued U.S. patent for validity. IPRs are
conducted before Administrative Patent Judges in the USPTO using a lower standard of proof than used in
federal district court and challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity. Generic drug
companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the IPR process in attempts to invalidate our
patents. In addition, in December 2023, the U.S. presidential administration released a proposed framework that
would permit the federal government to consider the price of a drug developed using federal funds as a factor in
determining whether it may exercise ""march-in rights"" and license it to a third party to manufacture. A comment
period on the proposal runs through February 6, 2024, and we are not able to predict whether a final rule will be
adopted in accordance with the proposed framework.
Outside the U.S., the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary
widely.

As a result, we expect that our
           U.S. patents on major pharmaceutical products, including biologics, will continue to be routinely
           challenged in litigation and may not be upheld. In addition, a separate IPR process currently allows
           competitors to seek invalidation of patents at the USPTO without the protections of the BPCIA or Hatch-
           Waxman Act. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the BPCIA or Hatch-
           Waxman Act is currently a topic of debate among legislators and the future ability of our competitors to
           use IPR proceedings as an alternative to Hatch-Waxman Act or BPCIA litigation procedures to challenge
           our patents remains uncertain. The USPTO issued an interim procedure regarding the use of
           discretionary denials of IPR proceedings when there is parallel district court litigation. However, it is not
           clear how this interim procedure could affect the ability of our competitors to institute IPR proceedings
           after institution of litigation. If our patents are challenged through this expedited review process, even if
           we prevail in demonstrating the validity of our patent, our win provides limited precedential value at the
           PTAB and no precedential value in federal district court, meaning the same patent can be challenged by
           other competitors.
           We face many generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the U.S. as well. The entry of
           generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues. In addition, competitors or
           other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by
           them. If successful, such claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular
           territory or being required to pay significant damages for past infringement or royalties on future sales. In
           addition, intellectual property protection in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. is weak and we face
           heightened risks to our intellectual property rights in these jurisdictions, including competition with generic
           or counterfeit versions of our products at or relatively shortly after launch. See Item 1, ""Business—
           Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights,"" and Item 8, ""Financial Statements and

unique product appearances that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations. Trademark
protection varies throughout the world. Trademark protection typically extends beyond the patent and data
protection for a product.

                                                                      12 We also rely in some circumstances on trade secrets and other unpatented know-how. We seek to protect our

Patent Licenses and Collaborations
Some of our products are subject to significant license and collaboration agreements. For information on our

Patent Challenges
In the U.S., the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the
Hatch-Waxman Act, authorizes the FDA to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other than
biologics) when the generic manufacturer files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA).
Absent a patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after certain of the innovator's patents expire.
However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA
alleging that the patent(s) listed in the innovator's New Drug Application (NDA) are invalid, unenforceable or not
infringed.
Generic manufacturers use this process extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals. In
addition, generic companies have shown willingness to launch ""at risk,"" i.e., after receiving ANDA approval but
before final resolution of their patent challenge.
Under the BPCIA, the FDA cannot approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires,
12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic, and an application may not be submitted until
four years following the date the innovator biologic was first approved.

Without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable
     to generate the returns necessary to support our significant investments in research and development, as
     well as the other expenditures required to bring new drugs and indications to the market. Intellectual
     property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time, depending on local
     laws and regulations. Changes to such laws, regulations, and enforcement practices could reduce
     protections for our innovative products and indications. For example, a proposal by the European
     Commission to revise the EU's general pharmaceutical legislation threatens the predictability and length
     of certain pharmaceutical intellectual property incentives, including by a two-year reduction of data
     package protection. Changes proposed by the USPTO and by certain bills in Congress to limit the
     number of, and differences between, patents obtained could also affect the scope of patent protection for
     our products in the U.S.
     In addition, in December 2023, the U.S. presidential administration released a proposed framework that
     would permit the federal government to consider the price of a drug developed using federal funds as a
     factor in determining whether it may exercise ""march-in rights"" and license it to a third party to

           biologic products, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides generic companies substantial incentives to seek to
           invalidate our patents covering small molecule pharmaceutical products. As a result, we expect that our
           U.S. patents on major pharmaceutical products, including biologics, will continue to be routinely
           challenged in litigation and may not be upheld. In addition, a separate IPR process currently allows

The Hatch-Waxman Act, officially known as the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, allows the FDA to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (excluding biologics) when a generic manufacturer files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). The FDA cannot approve an ANDA until certain innovator patents expire, but after four years of the innovator's product being marketed, a generic manufacturer can file an ANDA challenging the validity or enforceability of the innovator's patents. This process enables generic manufacturers to challenge patents extensively and even launch products ""at risk"" after receiving ANDA approval but before the resolution of their patent challenges.",The compound patent for Omvoh is expected to expire in Japan in 2039.,NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_20 and NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_21,2024-09-20 17:37:30

          similarly offer forms of patent term restoration. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates are
          available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap
          from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval) and in Japan patent terms can be extended up to five
          years.
In some cases, the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic, biosimilar, or other
follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through market dynamics
and challenges, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data
protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. The primary forms of data protection are
as follows:
     •    Data package protection generally prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications
          for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for the drug.
          The base period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics under the BPCIA, subject
          to certain conditions), effectively 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the
          date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patents.
     •    In the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the
          sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric populations within a specified time period. If granted, this
          ""pediatric exclusivity"" provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added to the term of data
          protection, orphan drug exclusivity and, for products other than biologics, to the term of any relevant and
          non-expired patents.
     •    A specific use of a drug or biologic can receive ""orphan"" designation in the U.S. if it is intended to treat a
          disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or where it is not reasonably
          expected to recover development and marketing costs through U.S. sales.

•    A specific use of a drug or biologic can receive ""orphan"" designation in the U.S. if it is intended to treat a
          disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or where it is not reasonably
          expected to recover development and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Orphan designation entitles a
          particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity, which runs in parallel with any applicable
          patents.
Outside the major markets, the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for
pharmaceuticals vary widely. International and U.S. free trade agreements like the Agreement on Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement) administered by the World Trade Organization provide
global protection of certain intellectual property rights. But in a number of markets we are unable to patent our
products or to enforce the patents that we receive for our products. Further, many developing countries, and
some developed countries, do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in the
TRIPs Agreement.
Our Intellectual Property Portfolio
We consider intellectual property protection for certain products, processes, uses, and formulations to be
important to our business. In addition to the patents and data protection identified below, we may hold patents on
manufacturing processes, formulations, devices, or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below.
For approved products, dates include, where applicable, pending or granted patent term extensions.

insurance_documents,"What are the criteria for a drug or biologic to receive ""orphan"" designation in the U.S.?","•    A specific use of a drug or biologic can receive ""orphan"" designation in the U.S. if it is intended to treat a
          disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or where it is not reasonably
          expected to recover development and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Orphan designation entitles a
          particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity, which runs in parallel with any applicable
          patents.
Outside the major markets, the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for
pharmaceuticals vary widely. International and U.S. free trade agreements like the Agreement on Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement) administered by the World Trade Organization provide
global protection of certain intellectual property rights. But in a number of markets we are unable to patent our
products or to enforce the patents that we receive for our products. Further, many developing countries, and
some developed countries, do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in the
TRIPs Agreement.
Our Intellectual Property Portfolio
We consider intellectual property protection for certain products, processes, uses, and formulations to be
important to our business. In addition to the patents and data protection identified below, we may hold patents on
manufacturing processes, formulations, devices, or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below.
For approved products, dates include, where applicable, pending or granted patent term extensions.

Where substitution is
mandatory, it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. In certain countries, intellectual
property protection is weak, and we must compete with generic versions of our products at or relatively shortly
after launch.
In addition, competition for our biologics, which constitute a substantial portion of our products and pipeline, may
be affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. A biosimilar is a subsequent version
of an approved innovator biologic that, due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic, may be
approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator
biologic.
Globally, most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as follow-
ons to innovator biologics, including the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) in

                                                                          8 the U.S. A number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, as well as in Europe and Japan.
Regulatory interpretation of important aspects of the laws regulating biosimilars continues to evolve, and
therefore the impact of these laws on our business remains subject to substantial uncertainty. For example, the
extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to
traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace
factors that are still developing.
Biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities. While competitors have developed
biosimilars that compete with our products, we have developed our own biosimilar and may develop others in the
future.
U.S. Private Sector Dynamics
In the U.S. private sector, consolidation and integration among healthcare organizations significantly affects the
competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit
managers, wholesalers, pharmacies, and other supply chain entities have been consolidating into fewer, larger
entities, thus enhancing their market power and importance.

          similarly offer forms of patent term restoration. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates are
          available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap
          from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval) and in Japan patent terms can be extended up to five
          years.
In some cases, the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic, biosimilar, or other
follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through market dynamics
and challenges, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data
protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. The primary forms of data protection are
as follows:
     •    Data package protection generally prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications
          for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for the drug.
          The base period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics under the BPCIA, subject
          to certain conditions), effectively 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the
          date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patents.
     •    In the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the
          sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric populations within a specified time period. If granted, this
          ""pediatric exclusivity"" provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added to the term of data
          protection, orphan drug exclusivity and, for products other than biologics, to the term of any relevant and
          non-expired patents.
     •    A specific use of a drug or biologic can receive ""orphan"" designation in the U.S. if it is intended to treat a
          disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or where it is not reasonably
          expected to recover development and marketing costs through U.S. sales.

For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United
States, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such
data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, although the CJEU upheld the
validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the Irish Data Protection
Committee (IDPC) issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic
Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine
of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into
compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the United States. We are appealing this decision and
the corrective orders are currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court. Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States
announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden
signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and
the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General as a ""qualifying state"" under Section 3(f) of the E.O.
On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United

•    We depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows,
     and earnings; the loss of effective intellectual property protection for certain of our products has
     resulted, and in the future is likely to continue to result, in rapid and severe declines in revenues
     for those products.
     In the ordinary course of their lifecycles, our products lose significant patent protection and/or data
     protection in the U.S., as well as in key jurisdictions outside the U.S., after a specified period of time.
     Some products also lose patent protection as a result of successful third-party challenges. We have
     faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition following the expiration or loss of such intellectual
     property protection.
     For non-biologic products, loss of exclusivity (whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination
     thereof as a consequence of litigation) typically results in the entry of one or more generic competitors,
     leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues, especially in the U.S. Generic pharmaceutical
     companies have in some cases introduced a generic product before resolution of any related patent
     litigation. For biologics, loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor
     versions (i.e., biosimilars) due to many factors, including development timelines, manufacturing
     challenges, and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory approval pathways.
     There is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be
     found valid and enforceable if challenged. Moreover, patents relating to particular products, uses,
     formulations, or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative processes or
     marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products. Patents held by
     third-parties have also contributed, and may in the future contribute, to a decision by us to not pursue all
     potential indications for a product candidate.

Without strong intellectual property protection, we would be unable
     to generate the returns necessary to support our significant investments in research and development, as
     well as the other expenditures required to bring new drugs and indications to the market. Intellectual
     property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time, depending on local
     laws and regulations. Changes to such laws, regulations, and enforcement practices could reduce
     protections for our innovative products and indications. For example, a proposal by the European
     Commission to revise the EU's general pharmaceutical legislation threatens the predictability and length
     of certain pharmaceutical intellectual property incentives, including by a two-year reduction of data
     package protection. Changes proposed by the USPTO and by certain bills in Congress to limit the
     number of, and differences between, patents obtained could also affect the scope of patent protection for
     our products in the U.S.
     In addition, in December 2023, the U.S. presidential administration released a proposed framework that
     would permit the federal government to consider the price of a drug developed using federal funds as a
     factor in determining whether it may exercise ""march-in rights"" and license it to a third party to
     manufacture. A comment period on the proposal runs through February 6, 2024, and we are not able to
     predict whether a final rule will be adopted in accordance with the proposed framework.

                                                                       28            Also in the U.S., in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the BPCIA, which applies to
           biologic products, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides generic companies substantial incentives to seek to
           invalidate our patents covering small molecule pharmaceutical products. As a result, we expect that our
           U.S. patents on major pharmaceutical products, including biologics, will continue to be routinely
           challenged in litigation and may not be upheld. In addition, a separate IPR process currently allows
           competitors to seek invalidation of patents at the USPTO without the protections of the BPCIA or Hatch-
           Waxman Act.

Supply chain entities have also increasingly imposed
utilization management tools to favor the use of generic products or otherwise limit access to our products. For

Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights
Overview
Intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations
and invest in the search for new medicines and uses. Loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals,
especially for non-biologic products, typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product,
often leading to a severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product. We own, have applied for, or are licensed
under, a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries relating to products, product uses,
formulations, and manufacturing processes. In addition, for some products we have effective intellectual property
protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.
The patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by patents claiming the
active ingredient (the compound patent) for our products, particularly those in major markets such as the U.S.,
major European countries, and Japan. In general, patents in each relevant country last for a period of 20 years
from their filing date, which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term
adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term:
     •    Patent term adjustment is available to all U.S. patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a
          patent grant is delayed during examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
     •    Patent term restoration for a single patent for a pharmaceutical product is provided to U.S. patent
          holders to compensate for a portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the U.S. Food and Drug
          Administration (FDA) review process. There is a five-year cap on any restoration, and no patent's

                                                                          9           expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from FDA approval. Some countries outside the U.S.
          similarly offer forms of patent term restoration.

Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) are used to extend the life of a European patent by up to an additional five years, subject to a 15-year cap from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval. They are designed to compensate patent holders for the time invested in clinical trials and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review process. Additionally, in Japan, patent terms can also be extended by up to five years.","The loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals, particularly non-biologic products, typically results in the loss of market exclusivity. This often leads to a rapid and severe decline in revenues for those products. Once patent protection expires or is lost, generic competitors can enter the market, which significantly impacts sales. The document highlights that generic pharmaceutical companies may even introduce generic products before the resolution of related patent litigation, further exacerbating revenue declines. Without strong intellectual property protection, companies may struggle to generate the necessary returns to support their investments in research and development.",NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_56 and NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_58 and NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_17,2024-09-20 17:38:17
insurance_documents,How has the consolidation and integration among healthcare organizations in the U.S. private sector affected pharmaceutical companies,"U.S. Private Sector Dynamics
In the U.S. private sector, consolidation and integration among healthcare organizations significantly affects the
competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit
managers, wholesalers, pharmacies, and other supply chain entities have been consolidating into fewer, larger
entities, thus enhancing their market power and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments,
typically maintain formularies that specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's
formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer) to control costs by negotiating
discounts or rebates in exchange for formulary inclusion and placement.
Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a product for the relevant patient population due to coverage
restrictions, such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations that result
in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers, increased co-insurance levels, and
higher deductibles. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies face increased pressure in negotiations, and
compete fiercely for formulary placement, not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy, safety
profile, or patient ease of use, but also by providing rebates or other concessions. As payers and pharmaceutical
companies continue to negotiate formulary placement and rebates, value-based agreements, where rebates may
be based on achievement (or not) of specified outcomes, are another increasingly prevalent tool. Rebates and
net cost are increasingly important factors in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the
payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. These pressures
have negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, our consolidated results of operations. In
addition to formulary placement, changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost-sharing
through high deductible plans, higher co-insurance, or co-pays, including increased utilization of co-pay
accumulator adjustment or maximization programs. Supply chain entities have also increasingly imposed
utilization management tools to favor the use of generic products or otherwise limit access to our products. For
additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see ""—Regulations and
Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access—U.S.""

In addition, in the U.S., most of our products are distributed through wholesalers and if one of these
   significant wholesalers should encounter financial or other difficulties, it might decrease the amount of
   business the wholesaler does with us or we might be unable to timely collect the amounts that the
   wholesaler owes us, which could negatively impact our results of operations. See Item 1, ""Business—
   Marketing and Distribution,"" for more details. Challenges to U.S. retail pharmacies due to pharmacy
   benefit manager reimbursement pressures, among other things, have resulted in financial difficulties for
   some pharmacies that may impact patient experiences, lead to determinations by certain pharmacies to
   not carry one or more of our significant products or threaten the viability of these pharmacies, which could
   negatively impact our business and results of operations.
   Moreover, the negotiating power of health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit
   managers, and other supply chain entities has increased due to consolidation, regulatory, and other
   market impacts, and they, along with governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and
   encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion, or favorable
   formulary placement. Such stakeholders have also increasingly imposed utilization management tools to
   favor the use of generic products or otherwise limit access to our products. As these practices expand,
   including due to potential further consolidation of U.S. private third-party payers, we may face difficulty in
   obtaining or maintaining timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products. We expect
   that consolidation of supply chain entities will continue to increase competitive and pricing pressures on
   pharmaceutical manufacturers.
   Pharmacy benefit manager practices have come under increased scrutiny from U.S. policymakers at the
   federal and state level who have proposed legislation intended to address concerns regarding the impact
   that these intermediaries have on drug pricing and patients’ out of pocket costs. If promulgated, such
   legislation could have resultant implications, costs, or consequences for our business and how we interact
   with these entities. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical
   products, see Item 1, ""Business—U.S. Private Sector Dynamics"" and ""Regulations and Private Payer
   Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access—U.S.""

Where substitution is
mandatory, it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. In certain countries, intellectual
property protection is weak, and we must compete with generic versions of our products at or relatively shortly
after launch.
In addition, competition for our biologics, which constitute a substantial portion of our products and pipeline, may
be affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. A biosimilar is a subsequent version
of an approved innovator biologic that, due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic, may be
approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator
biologic.
Globally, most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as follow-
ons to innovator biologics, including the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) in

                                                                          8 the U.S. A number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, as well as in Europe and Japan.
Regulatory interpretation of important aspects of the laws regulating biosimilars continues to evolve, and
therefore the impact of these laws on our business remains subject to substantial uncertainty. For example, the
extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to
traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace
factors that are still developing.
Biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities. While competitors have developed
biosimilars that compete with our products, we have developed our own biosimilar and may develop others in the
future.

We believe our long-term competitive success depends on discovering and developing (either alone or in
collaboration with others) or acquiring innovative, cost-effective products that provide improved outcomes for
patients and deliver value to payers, and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly
competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful
products, and it is possible that our products will be, or will become, uncompetitive from time to time as a result
of products or uses developed by our competitors.
Generic Pharmaceuticals and Biosimilars
Generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars can pose major competitive challenges to our business. In most major
jurisdictions, the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals (other than biological products (biologics))
exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing
generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. As a result, generic
manufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do for our branded products in research and
development and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products. Accordingly, when a
branded non-biologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from
generic forms of the product, which can result in the loss of a significant portion of the branded product's revenue
in a very short period of time. Moreover, governments in some countries leverage generic entrants to drive price
concessions through the utilization of volume-based procurement bidding and other measures.
Further, public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to branded products.
Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in many cases require, pharmacists to substitute generics that have been
rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a branded product. Where substitution is
mandatory, it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. In certain countries, intellectual
property protection is weak, and we must compete with generic versions of our products at or relatively shortly
after launch.

Our
   product revenues and prospects are adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded
   products that are first to market, have better marketplace access, have greater brand recognition or are
   perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, and
   by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products.
   Our revenues are also adversely affected by treatment innovations, including new or superior modalities,
   that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs.
   Regulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world and such regulation is complex and
   subject to ongoing interpretation and implementation by regulatory agencies and courts. Particularly for
   biosimilars, health authority guidelines and legislative actions could make it less burdensome for
   competitor products to enter the market and further incentivize uptake of biosimilars. Given the
   importance to us of marketed biologic products and those in our clinical-stage pipeline, such regulation
   could have a material adverse effect on our business. See Item 1, ""Business—Competition"" and
   ""Business—Research and Development,"" for more details. Alternatively, actual or perceived failure of
   robust generic and biosimilar competition could propel governments to adopt additional policies and
   legislation that threaten our intellectual property, pricing of our products, or other aspects of our business.
   In addition, we rely on our ability to attract, engage, and retain highly qualified and skilled scientific,
   technical, management, and other personnel in order to compete effectively. To continue to commercialize
   our products, and advance the research, development, and commercialization of additional modalities,
   indications, and product candidates, we have expanded, and will likely need to further expand, our
   workforce, including in the areas of manufacturing, clinical trials management, regulatory affairs, and
   sales and marketing, both in and outside the U.S. We continue to face intense competition for qualified
   individuals from numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic
   and other research institutions, as well as employers near our manufacturing and other facilities, which
   has and may continue to increase our labor costs. Our ability to attract and retain talent in our increasingly
   competitive environment is further complicated by evolving employment trends.

In addition, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new
   personnel or the operations of the businesses, products, or assets we acquire (including related
   technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, information security, manufacturing,
   distribution, and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the
   expected benefits of business development transactions and may result in our incurrence of substantial
   asset impairment or restructuring charges. We also may fail to generate the expected revenue and
   pipeline enhancement from business development activities due to limited diligence opportunities,
   unsuccessful clinical trials, issues related to the quality, integrity, or broad applicability of data, regulatory
   impediments, and manufacturing or commercialization challenges. Additionally, business development
   activity focused on new modalities may entail additional risks and costs. Accordingly, business
   development transactions may not be completed in a timely manner (if at all), may not result in successful
   development outcomes or successful commercialization of any product, may give rise to legal
   proceedings or regulatory scrutiny, and may result in charges that negatively impact our financial position
   or results of operations in any given period.

•  We and our products face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies,
   biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such
   competition could have a material adverse effect on our business.
   We compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies,
   and generic pharmaceutical companies and, in many cases, our products compete against the leading
   products of one or more of our competitors. To compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the
   market innovative, cost-effective products through internal innovation or business development that meet
   important medical needs, provide improved outcomes for patients, and deliver value to payers. Our

The factors influencing the substitution of biosimilars for innovator biologics include regulatory pathways, market dynamics, and the evolving interpretation of laws governing biosimilars.

The approval of biosimilars, which are subsequent versions of innovator biologics, relies on their analytical and clinical similarity to the original products, allowing for an abbreviated data package.

This consolidation increases pressure on pharmaceutical companies during negotiations for formulary placement, requiring them to compete not only on product attributes but also through rebates and concessions. As a result, the negotiating power of these entities has grown, leading to heightened competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers.","Generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars pose significant competitive challenges to the company's business.

Consequently, when a branded product loses market exclusivity, it often faces intense price competition from generics, leading to a rapid loss of revenue.

Additionally, governments in some countries use generic entrants to drive price concessions, and both public and private payers encourage the use of generics over branded products. In the U.S., laws often allow pharmacists to substitute generics for branded products unless explicitly prohibited by the prescribing physician. Weak intellectual property protection in certain countries can also lead to competition from generics shortly after a product's launch.

For biologics, the introduction of biosimilars can further impact competition, as these follow-on products may enter the market with less regulatory burden, potentially affecting the company's revenues and prospects. The overall competitive landscape is influenced by the introduction of new branded products, treatment innovations, and the evolving regulatory environment for generics and biosimilars, which could adversely affect the company's business.",NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_14 and NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_50 and NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_49,2024-09-20 17:38:57

Competition
Our products compete globally with many other pharmaceutical products in highly competitive markets.
Important competitive factors include effectiveness, safety, and ease of use; formulary placement, price, payer
coverage and reimbursement rates, and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; regulatory approvals; marketing
effectiveness; and research and development of new products, processes, modalities, and uses. Early market
entry and rapid patient access can also be important to achieve product acceptance and success.
Most new products or uses that we introduce must compete with other branded, biosimilar, or generic products
already on the market or that are later developed by competitors. When competitors introduce new products,
uses, or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages, including by developing new modalities, our
products become subject to decreased sales volumes, progressive price reductions, or both.
We believe our long-term competitive success depends on discovering and developing (either alone or in
collaboration with others) or acquiring innovative, cost-effective products that provide improved outcomes for
patients and deliver value to payers, and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly
competitive environment.

Products that we
choose to tender through this process are similarly subject to price reductions. Our performance in China may be
significantly impacted by the country's evolving pharmaceutical regulatory environment, including access,
intellectual property protection, regulatory enforcement and compliance, and trade policies.

controls and measures impacting intellectual property. Reforms in our product markets, including those that may
stem from periods of uneven economic growth or downturns or uncertainty, or as a result of high inflation,
emergence, or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts, or government budgeting
priorities, may continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.
We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by current or potential future legislative,
regulatory, or payer developments. However, in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing,
resulting in additional state, federal, and international legislative and regulatory developments that could have
further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our products as well as overall operations.
See Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Trends Affecting
Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access"" for additional information regarding recent legislative,
administrative, and other pricing initiatives and their impact on our results.
Research and Development
Our commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years. We invest heavily in research
and development because we believe it is critical to our long-term competitiveness. At the end of 2023, we
employed approximately 10,000 people in pharmaceutical research and development activities, including a
substantial number of physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees, and highly skilled
technical personnel.
Our internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of metabolism (including diabetes, obesity
and cardiovascular), immunology, neuroscience, and oncology. In addition to discovering and developing new
medicines, we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses, formulations, and therapeutic
approaches, including complementary delivery devices or diagnostic tools, that can provide additional value to
patients.
To supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with others, including academic institutions and research-
based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

In addition, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new
   personnel or the operations of the businesses, products, or assets we acquire (including related
   technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, information security, manufacturing,
   distribution, and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the
   expected benefits of business development transactions and may result in our incurrence of substantial
   asset impairment or restructuring charges. We also may fail to generate the expected revenue and
   pipeline enhancement from business development activities due to limited diligence opportunities,
   unsuccessful clinical trials, issues related to the quality, integrity, or broad applicability of data, regulatory
   impediments, and manufacturing or commercialization challenges. Additionally, business development
   activity focused on new modalities may entail additional risks and costs. Accordingly, business
   development transactions may not be completed in a timely manner (if at all), may not result in successful
   development outcomes or successful commercialization of any product, may give rise to legal
   proceedings or regulatory scrutiny, and may result in charges that negatively impact our financial position
   or results of operations in any given period.
   See Item 1, ""Business—Research and Development—Phases of New Drug Development"" and Item 7,
   ""Management's Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Late-Stage Pipeline,"" for more details
   about our current product pipeline.
•  We and our products face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies,
   biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such
   competition could have a material adverse effect on our business.
   We compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies,
   and generic pharmaceutical companies and, in many cases, our products compete against the leading
   products of one or more of our competitors. To compete successfully, we must continue to deliver to the
   market innovative, cost-effective products through internal innovation or business development that meet
   important medical needs, provide improved outcomes for patients, and deliver value to payers. Our
   product revenues and prospects are adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded
   products that are first to market, have better marketplace access, have greater brand recognition or are
   perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, and
   by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products.

Generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars pose significant competitive challenges to the company's business. The regulatory approval process for generics typically exempts them from extensive clinical trials, allowing them to rely on the safety and efficacy of the original branded products. This results in generic manufacturers investing far fewer resources in research and development, enabling them to price their products much lower than branded products. Consequently, when a branded product loses market exclusivity, it often faces intense price competition from generics, leading to a rapid loss of revenue.

Additionally, governments in some countries use generic entrants to drive price concessions, and both public and private payers encourage the use of generics over branded products. In the U.S., laws often allow pharmacists to substitute generics for branded products unless explicitly prohibited by the prescribing physician. Weak intellectual property protection in certain countries can also lead to competition from generics shortly after a product's launch.

For biologics, the introduction of biosimilars can further impact competition, as these follow-on products may enter the market with less regulatory burden, potentially affecting the company's revenues and prospects. The overall competitive landscape is influenced by the introduction of new branded products, treatment innovations, and the evolving regulatory environment for generics and biosimilars, which could adversely affect the company's business.","Important factors for a product to compete successfully in the global pharmaceutical market include:

1. **Effectiveness, Safety, and Ease of Use**: Products must demonstrate these qualities to gain acceptance.
2. **Formulary Placement**: How well a product is positioned within healthcare formularies can impact its accessibility.
3. **Price and Payer Coverage**: Competitive pricing and favorable reimbursement rates are crucial for market success.
4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Demonstrating value to payers is essential.
5. **Regulatory Approvals**: Obtaining necessary approvals is a key step in product launch.
6. **Marketing Effectiveness**: Strong marketing strategies can enhance product visibility and acceptance.
7. **Research and Development**: Continuous innovation and development of new products, processes, and uses are vital.
8. **Early Market Entry**: Rapid access to the market can lead to better product acceptance.
9. **Competition from Other Products**: Products must compete against branded, biosimilar, and generic alternatives.

Overall, long-term competitive success relies on discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that improve patient outcomes and deliver value to payers.",NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_13 and NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_34 and NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_49,2024-09-20 17:39:09
insurance_documents,"Which three wholesale distributors in the U.S. accounted for a significant percentage of the company's consolidated revenue in 2023, 2022, and 2021?","Sales of products to distributors accounted for 57% and 56% of
our net revenue for ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Direct sales to WT Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a distributor, accounted for 21% and 20% of our net
revenue for ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe aggregate sales to our top ﬁve end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately
35% of our net revenue for each of ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022. We believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for approximately 20%
of our net revenue for each of ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022. We expect to continue to experience signiﬁcant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of,
or signiﬁcant decrease in demand from, any of our top ﬁve end customers could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of operations and
ﬁnancial condition.
        From time to time, some of our key semiconductor customers place large orders or delay orders, causing our quarterly net revenue to ﬂuctuate
signiﬁcantly. This is particularly true of our wireless products as ﬂuctuations may be magniﬁed by the timing of launches, and seasonal variations in sales, of
mobile devices. In addition, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and may cause our net revenue to ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly and impact our results
of operations.
        Although we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in Penang, Malaysia, we disclose net revenue by country
based primarily on the geographic shipment or delivery location speciﬁed by our distributors, OEMs, contract manufacturers, channel partners, or software
customers. In ﬁscal years 2023 and 2022, 32% and 35%, respectively, of our net revenue came from shipments or deliveries to China (including Hong Kong).
However, the end customers for either our products or for the end products into which our products are incorporated, are frequently located in countries other
than China (including Hong Kong).

                   We sell most of our products worldwide. We adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various
                   countries to meet local customer needs and comply with local regulations.
                   U.S.
                   We promote our major products in the U.S. through sales representatives who engage with physicians and other
                   healthcare professionals. We also educate healthcare providers about our products in various other ways,
                   including promoting in online channels, distributing literature and samples of certain products to physicians, and
                   exhibiting at medical meetings. In addition, we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the U.S., and
                   we maintain websites and other media channels (e.g., social media) with information about our major products.
                   We supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations to leverage our resources and reach
                   additional patients in need.
                   Our account managers service wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations, group
                   purchasing organizations, government and long-term care institutions, hospitals, and certain retail pharmacies.
                   We enter into arrangements with these organizations to provide discounts or rebates on our products.
                   In the U.S., most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and
                   other healthcare professionals, and hospitals. In 2023, 2022, and 2021, three wholesale distributors in the U.S.—
                   McKesson Corporation, Cencora, Inc. (formerly AmerisourceBergen Corporation), and Cardinal Health, Inc.—
                   each accounted for a significant percentage of our consolidated revenue. No other customer accounted for more
                   than 10 percent of our consolidated revenue in any of these years. For additional information, see Item 8,
                   ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2: Revenue.""

2022 versus 2021
        Retailing group revenues increased $337 million (1.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting an increase at BHA,
partially offset by combined lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA’s revenues increased 6.1% in 2022 compared to
2021. Revenues from new and used retail vehicle sales increased 5.9% compared to 2021, attributable to higher average vehicle
transaction prices, partly offset by a 4.5% decline in total retail units sold. New vehicle unit sales in 2022 were constrained by
relatively low, but gradually rising, new vehicle supplies. Revenues from BHA’s parts/service/repair operations increased
11.1% versus 2021. Revenues of the home furnishings group declined 2.6%, while revenues of all other retailers declined 8.9%,
primarily due to lower sales at Pampered Chef.
        Pre-tax earnings of the retailing group decreased $85 million (4.7%) in 2022 compared to 2021 and the pre-tax margin
rate decreased 0.6 percentage points to 8.9%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 18.4%, primarily due to increases in vehicle
gross profit margins attributable to low available inventory. BHA’s vehicle gross profit margin rates accelerated during the
second half of 2021, peaked in the first half of 2022 and declined over the remainder of the year. Aggregate pre-tax earnings
for the remainder of the retailing group decreased $233 million (23.2%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to reduced
earnings from the home furnishings group, See’s Candies and Pampered Chef.

There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development, the
introduction of new products and indications, business development activities to enhance or refine or product
pipeline, and commercialization of our products. There is a high rate of failure inherent in drug discovery and
development. To bring a product from the discovery phase to market takes considerable time and entails
significant cost. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial
investment. As a result, most funds invested in research and development programs will not generate
financial returns.

For example, regulatory or legislative actions or
litigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in
various ways, including for advertising, could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our
services or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue.

        We are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain
data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services.
For example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States,
called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other
bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For
example, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought
by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final
Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was
not in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to
suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including
storage, of such data in the United States. We are appealing this decision and the corrective orders are currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High
Court.

        On March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy
Framework (EU-U.S. DPF).

For example, regulatory or legislative actions or
litigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in
various ways, including for advertising, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, could adversely affect our financial results,
including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court
heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act
(Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various efforts to
remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230, and any such changes may increase our costs or require
significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.

         We are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain
data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services.
If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products
and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely
affect our financial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United
States, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such
data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny.

We often enter into collaborative and other arrangements to develop and commercialize drug candidates or to
sell the rights of a product. See Note 2 for a discussion of our recognition of revenue from our collaborations
and other arrangements.
Collaborative activities may include research and development, marketing and selling, manufacturing, and
distribution for which we may receive from or pay to the collaboration partner expense reimbursements.
Operating expenses for costs incurred pursuant to these arrangements are reported in their respective
expense line item, net of any payments due to or reimbursements due from our collaboration partners, with
such reimbursements being recognized at the time the party becomes obligated to pay. Each arrangement is
unique in nature, and our more significant arrangements are discussed below.
Boehringer Ingelheim Diabetes Collaboration
We and Boehringer Ingelheim have a global agreement to jointly develop and commercialize a portfolio of
diabetes compounds. Currently included in the collaboration are Boehringer Ingelheim's oral diabetes
products: Jardiance, Glyxambi, Synjardy, Trijardy XR, Trajenta, and Jentadueto® as well as our basal insulins,
Basaglar and Rezvoglar. Glyxambi, Synjardy, and Trijardy XR are included in the Jardiance product family.
Jentadueto is included in the Trajenta product family. Rezvoglar is included in the Basaglar product family.
In connection with the regulatory approvals of Jardiance, Trajenta, and Basaglar in the U.S., Europe, and
Japan, milestone payments made for Jardiance and Trajenta were capitalized as intangible assets and are
being amortized to cost of sales, and milestone payments received for Basaglar were recorded as contract
liabilities and are being amortized to collaboration and other revenue. Net milestones capitalized with respect
to Jardiance and Trajenta and net milestones deferred with respect to Basaglar are not material.
For the Jardiance product family, we and Boehringer Ingelheim generally share equally the ongoing
development and commercialization costs in the most significant markets, and we record our portion of the
development and commercialization costs as research and development expense and marketing, selling, and
administrative expense, respectively.

Item 1.               Business
Eli Lilly and Company (referred to as the company, Lilly, we, or us) was incorporated in 1901 in Indiana to
succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. We
discover, develop, manufacture, and market products in a single business segment—human pharmaceutical
products.
Our purpose is to unite caring with discovery to create medicines that make life better for people around the
world. Most of the products that we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists, and our long-
term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative
medicines.
We manufacture and distribute our products through facilities in the United States (U.S.), including Puerto Rico,
and in Europe and Asia. Our products are sold in approximately 105 countries.

financial position, results of operations and cash flows; the approval and implementation of the potential certificate
of incorporation amendments and the potential exchange offers; prospects,                         developments, strategies         and growth
of  our  business;     anticipated    expansion of      our  products    in  certain  countries;    industry   developments;       anticipated
timing   and benefits of our acquisitions;         expectations regarding litigation matters,           investigations and proceedings;
timing   and amount      of  stock   repurchases; sufficiency of sources           of  liquidity and funding; effectiveness         of our   risk
management         programs;     and   expectations     regarding     the  impact    of  recent   accounting      pronouncements        on   our
consolidated      financial    statements.      Forward-looking       statements      generally     are   identified   by    words    such    as
“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “projects,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “continue” and
other   similar    expressions.     All  statements      other   than    statements     of   historical   fact  could    be  forward-looking
statements,     which speak      only   as of   the date   they are    made, are     not guarantees       of future   performance      and are
subject to certain     risks, uncertainties and other         factors, many     of which are beyond our control           and are    difficult to
predict.   We    describe     risks  and    uncertainties    that   could   cause    actual    results   to  differ  materially    from   those
expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements in Item 1, Item 1A, Item 7 and elsewhere in
this report.

All statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K other than
statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our
objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words ""believe,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""estimate,"" ""continue,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""expect,""
and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current
expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-
term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties
and assumptions, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive
and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact

The following graph compares the return on Lilly stock with that of the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Stock
Index and our peer group for the years 2019 through 2023. The graph assumes that, on the last business day
of 2018, a person invested $100 each in Lilly stock, the S&P 500 Stock Index, and the peer group's collective
common stock. The graph measures total shareholder return, which takes into account both stock price and
dividends. It assumes that dividends paid by a company are immediately reinvested in that company's stock.

The following graph compares the return on Lilly stock with that of the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Stock
Index and our peer group for the years 2019 through 2023. The graph assumes that, on the last business day
of 2018, a person invested $100 each in Lilly stock, the S&P 500 Stock Index, and the peer group's collective
common stock. The graph measures total shareholder return, which takes into account both stock price and
dividends. It assumes that dividends paid by a company are immediately reinvested in that company's stock.

The aggregate market value of the common equity held by non-affiliates of Eli Lilly and Company, as of the last business day of the Registrant's most recently completed second fiscal quarter, is approximately $398,291,000,000.",The trading symbol for Eli Lilly and Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange is LLY.,NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_1 and NYSE_LLY_2023.pdf_80 and NYSE_PG_2023.pdf_15,2024-09-20 17:41:08
insurance_documents,How could changes in tax laws and regulations impact the company?,"In addition, increasing
governmental and societal attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, including expanding mandatory
and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change, waste production, water usage, human
capital, labor and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control,
assess and report. These and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations as well as increased
enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies, create challenges for the Company, may alter the
environment in which we do business, may increase the ongoing costs and complexities of compliance including by requiring
investments in technology or other compliance systems, and may ultimately result in the need to cease manufacturing, sales or
other business activities in certain jurisdictions, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. If we
are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it
could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. Additionally, we are currently, and in the future may be,
subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, claims, proceedings and requests for information from governmental agencies
or private parties, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business. Failure to successfully manage these new or pending
regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially
adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, if new or pending legal or
regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of
operations and financial position.
Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial
results.
The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the various tax laws can and do
occur. For example, in December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Act). The changes included in the U.S. Tax Act were broad and complex. Under the
current U.S. presidential administration, comprehensive federal income tax reform has been proposed, including an increase in
the U.S. Federal corporate income tax rate, elimination of certain investment incentives and an increase in U.S.

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate
for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions
in the United States or globally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued
or such actions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have
enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we
operate our business.

         Over the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries
in which we do business. As of July 2023, nearly 140 countries have approved a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions.
As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax
obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current
tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or
impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes
applicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our business.

         The European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides
preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state
aid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.

Similarly, increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the
  volume of transactions processed through our systems, or may otherwise impact the competitiveness of our products. Actions by
  regulators could influence other organizations around the world to enact or consider adopting similar measures, amplifying any
  potential compliance burden. Additionally, our compliance with new economic sanctions and related laws with respect to particular
  jurisdictions or customers could result in a loss of business, which could be significant. Woreover, while our risk-based compliance
  program obligates issuers and acquirers to comply with c.S., Ec and local sanctions programs (among other obligations), the failure
  of those issuers and acquirers to identify potential non-compliance issues either during or after their customer onboarding processes
  could ultimately impact our compliance with economic sanctions and related laws. Finally, failure to comply with the laws and
  regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties. In particular, a violation and
  subsequent judgment or settlement against us, or those with whom we may be associated, under economic sanctions and AWL, CFT,
  and anti-corruption laws could subject us to substantial monetary penalties, damages, and4or have a significant reputational impact.
  Each instance may individually or collectively materially and adversely affect our financial performance and4or our overall business
  and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our reputation.
  We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.
  ee are subject to tax laws and regulations of the c.S. federal, state and local governments as well as various non-c.S. jurisdictions.
  Current and potential future changes in existing tax laws, including regulatory guidance, are continuously being considered and have
  been or may be enacted (such as guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which
  impact how multinational enterprises are taxed on their global profits). These changes have and in the future may continue to have
  an impact on our effective income tax rate and tax payments. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our
  customers and counterparties, or the economy generally, have impacted and may continue to impact us as well.

While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of
claims that may arise.

                                                                                     Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased
costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.
The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data
localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership
and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film
and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign
exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety,
including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.

Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by
increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the
Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain
and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.
These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial
services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no
assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the
Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and
financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance
notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures.","Changes in tax laws and regulations could negatively affect the company's financial results. The company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, and changes in tax laws can significantly impact its tax obligations and effective tax rate. For instance, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 had a notable effect on the company's tax obligations for that quarter. Future changes in tax laws, including proposed increases in corporate tax rates or new types of taxes, could further increase tax obligations and alter the manner in which the company operates.

Additionally, ongoing international tax initiatives, such as the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, may also change the framework for determining tax obligations, potentially leading to increased tax liabilities. The company could face challenges from regulatory investigations or changes in tax treatment of foreign operations, which could adversely impact its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.",NYSE_PG_2023.pdf_41 and NASDAQ_FB_2023.pdf_81 and NYSE_MA_2023.pdf_57 and NASDAQ_AAPL_2023.pdf_34,2024-09-20 17:44:26

  an impact on our effective income tax rate and tax payments. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our
  customers and counterparties, or the economy generally, have impacted and may continue to impact us as well.
  In addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with
  applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Turisdictions
  around the globe have also increased tax-related audits, which require time and resources to resolve.

Litigation
Liabilities we may incur or limitations on our business related to any litigation or litigation settlements could materially and
adversely affect our results of operations.
ee are a defendant in a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings and investigations, including among others, those
alleging violations of competition and antitrust law and those involving intellectual property claims (as described in Note 21 (Legal
and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item B). In the event we are found liable in
any material litigations or proceedings (particularly in a large class-action lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the
plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable), we could be subject to significant damages, which
could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.
Certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation and litigation settlements, such as changes
to our no-surcharge rule in the c.S. and Canada. Any future limitations on our business resulting from the outcomes of any litigation
or regulatory proceeding, including any changes to our rules or business practices, could impact our relationships with our
customers, including reducing the volume of business that we do with them, which may materially and adversely affect our overall
business and results of operations.

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate
for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions
in the United States or globally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued
or such actions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have
enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we
operate our business.

         Over the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries
in which we do business. As of July 2023, nearly 140 countries have approved a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions.
As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax
obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current
tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or
impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes
applicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our business.

         The European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides
preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state
aid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.

Similarly, increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the
  volume of transactions processed through our systems, or may otherwise impact the competitiveness of our products. Actions by
  regulators could influence other organizations around the world to enact or consider adopting similar measures, amplifying any
  potential compliance burden. Additionally, our compliance with new economic sanctions and related laws with respect to particular
  jurisdictions or customers could result in a loss of business, which could be significant. Woreover, while our risk-based compliance
  program obligates issuers and acquirers to comply with c.S., Ec and local sanctions programs (among other obligations), the failure
  of those issuers and acquirers to identify potential non-compliance issues either during or after their customer onboarding processes
  could ultimately impact our compliance with economic sanctions and related laws. Finally, failure to comply with the laws and
  regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties. In particular, a violation and
  subsequent judgment or settlement against us, or those with whom we may be associated, under economic sanctions and AWL, CFT,
  and anti-corruption laws could subject us to substantial monetary penalties, damages, and4or have a significant reputational impact.
  Each instance may individually or collectively materially and adversely affect our financial performance and4or our overall business
  and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our reputation.
  We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.
  ee are subject to tax laws and regulations of the c.S. federal, state and local governments as well as various non-c.S. jurisdictions.
  Current and potential future changes in existing tax laws, including regulatory guidance, are continuously being considered and have
  been or may be enacted (such as guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which
  impact how multinational enterprises are taxed on their global profits). These changes have and in the future may continue to have
  an impact on our effective income tax rate and tax payments. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our
  customers and counterparties, or the economy generally, have impacted and may continue to impact us as well.

While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of
claims that may arise.

                                                                                     Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased
costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.
The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data
localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership
and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film
and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign
exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety,
including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.

Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by
increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the
Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain
and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.
These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial
services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no
assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the
Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and
financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance
notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures.

Changes in tax laws and regulations could negatively affect the company's financial results. The company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, and changes in tax laws can significantly impact its tax obligations and effective tax rate. For instance, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 had a notable effect on the company's tax obligations for that quarter. Future changes in tax laws, including proposed increases in corporate tax rates or new types of taxes, could further increase tax obligations and alter the manner in which the company operates.

Additionally, ongoing international tax initiatives, such as the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, may also change the framework for determining tax obligations, potentially leading to increased tax liabilities. The company could face challenges from regulatory investigations or changes in tax treatment of foreign operations, which could adversely impact its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.","Changes in tax laws and regulations could significantly impact the company by affecting its effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition, and results of operations.

This type of regulation and oversight is related to switching activities (authorization, clearing and
settlement), and includes policies, procedures and requirements related to risk management, collateral, participant default, timely
switching of financial transactions, and capital and financial resources. Parts of our business have also been deemed as a “specified
service provider” or considered “critical infrastructure”. The impact to our business created by any new law, regulation or
designation is magnified by the potential it has to be replicated in, or conflict with, other jurisdictions, or involve other products
within any particular jurisdiction.
The expansion of our products and services as part of our multi-rail strategy has also created the need for us to obtain new types and
increasing numbers of regulatory licenses, resulting in increased supervision and additional compliance burdens distinct from those
imposed on our core payment network activities. For example, certain of our subsidiaries maintain money transfer licenses to
support certain activities.            These licenses typically impose supervisory and examination requirements, as well as capital,
safeguarding, risk management and other business obligations.
Increased regulation and oversight of payments systems, as well as increased exposure to regulation resulting from changes to our
products and services, have resulted and may continue to result in significant compliance and governance burdens or otherwise
increase our costs. As a result, customers could be less willing to participate in our payments system and4or use our other products

Other jurisdictions have adopted or are otherwise considering adopting sector-specific regulations for the payments industry and
other industries in which we participate, including forced data sharing requirements or additional verification requirements. In
addition, laws and regulations on AI, data governance and credit decisioning may overlap or conflict with, or diverge from, general
privacy rules. Overall, these myriad laws and regulations may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, incur
substantial compliance-related costs and expenses, and otherwise suffer adverse impacts on our business. Failure to comply with
any of these laws, regulations and requirements could result in fines, sanctions or other enforcement actions or penalties, which
could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business, as well as have an impact on our reputation.
As a user and deployer of AI technology, we are also subject to increasing and evolving laws and regulations related to AI governance
and new applications of existing laws and regulations to AI. Row our use and deployment of AI will be regulated remains uncertain
given the uncertainty that exists as to how AI technology will develop. In addition, the use of AI creates or amplifies risks that are
challenging to fully prevent or mitigate. In particular, AI algorithms may generate inaccurate, unintended, unfair or discriminatory
outcomes, which may not be easily detectable or explainable, and may inadvertently breach intellectual property, privacy or other
rights, as well as confidential information. Our implementation of robust AI governance and risk management frameworks aimed at
complying with emerging laws and regulations may not be sufficient protection against these emerging risks.
Further, as we acquire new companies and develop integrated and personalized products and services to meet the needs of a
changing marketplace, we have expanded our data profile through additional data types and sources, across multiple channels, and

•   Regional groups of countries are considering, or may consider, efforts to restrict our switching of regional transactions.

For        example, in the      U.S.,  certain  stakeholders have raised         concerns
regarding    how   payment     security   standards    and rules    may    impact debit    routing choice     and   the  cost  of  payment
card   acceptance.      In  addition   to  ongoing     litigation related   to  the   U.S.   migration    to  EMV-capable       cards    and
point-of-sale terminals,      U.S. merchant-affiliated      groups    and processors       have   expressed     concerns regarding        the
EMV    certification   process   and some      policymakers      have   expressed     concerns about      the  roles   of industry   bodies
such as EMVCo and the Payment Card Industry Security                    Standards Council in the development of             payment card
standards.    Additionally,    many    merchants      have   advocated     for  lower   acceptance      costs   in the  form   of reduced
interchange rates,      which could     result   in some    issuers   eliminating    or reducing     their promotion or      use of Visa’s
products    and    services,   eliminating    or  reducing     cardholder    benefits    such   as   rewards    programs,      or  charging
account    holders increased or        new   fees for   using   Visa-branded      products,    all of  which could     negatively impact
Visa’s   transaction   volumes     and   related   revenues.    Finally, some     merchants and       processors     have   advocated     for
changes     to  industry practices     and Visa acceptance         requirements      at  the point   of sale, including the       ability for
merchants     to  accept    only certain    types   of  Visa  products,    to  mandate     only   PIN   authenticated     transactions,    to
differentiate or steer among Visa product types issued by different financial institutions, and to impose surcharges
on customers       presenting Visa products         as their form     of payment.     If successful,    these   efforts could    adversely
impact consumers’ usage of our products and decrease our overall transaction volumes and fee revenues, lead to
regulatory    enforcement      and/or   litigation that   increases our     compliance      and   litigation expenses,     and ultimately
harm our business.

The efforts of regional jurisdictions to restrict global switching capabilities could significantly impact the company's operations in several ways:

1. **Inability to Utilize Global Switching**: Restrictions may prevent the company from using its global switching capabilities for domestic or regional customers, which could adversely affect revenue and brand extension.

2. **Compliance Pressures**: If jurisdictions determine that the company is not in compliance with regulatory requirements, it may face resource and time pressures to achieve compliance, impacting operational efficiency.

3. **Technological and Operational Challenges**: Requirements to collect, store, and process data within specific borders can lead to significant technological and operational challenges, necessitating modifications to data processing practices.

4. **Increased Compliance Costs**: Adapting to new privacy and data protection laws may incur substantial compliance-related costs, affecting overall financial performance.

5. **Competitive Disadvantages**: Foreign ownership restrictions could force the transfer of technology and proprietary information, hindering competitiveness in those markets.

6. **Legal Risks**: Non-compliance with regulations could result in fines and sanctions, negatively impacting the company's operations and reputation.

7. **Market Access Barriers**: Government-imposed barriers may prevent the company from competing effectively in significant markets, such as China and India, limiting growth opportunities.

Overall, these developments could materially and adversely affect the company's ability to maintain or increase revenues and compete effectively in various jurisdictions.","The ability of Canadian merchants to surcharge credit cards could lead to several impacts on the usage of electronic payment products.

      domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies.
  •   Some jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering, requirements to collect, store and4or process data within their

  we charge our customers could also materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Regulators could also require us to
  obtain prior approval for changes to our system rules, procedures or operations, or could require customization with regard to such
  changes, which could negatively impact us. Woreover, failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could
  result in fines, sanctions, civil damages or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and
  results of operations, as well as have an impact on our brand and reputation.
  Increased regulatory, legislative and litigation activity with respect to interchange rates could have an adverse impact on our
  business.
  Interchange rates are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of products
  associated with our core payment network. Although we do not earn revenues from interchange, interchange rates can impact the
  volume of transactions we see on our payment products. If interchange rates are too high, merchants may stop accepting our
  products or route transactions away from our network. If interchange rates are too low, issuers may stop promoting our products
  and services, eliminate or reduce loyalty rewards programs or other account holder benefits (e.g., free checking or low interest rates
  on balances), or charge fees to account holders (e.g., annual fees or late payment fees).
  Governments and merchant groups in a number of countries have implemented or are seeking interchange rate reductions through
  legislation, regulation and litigation. See “Business - Government Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory
  Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item B for more details.
  If issuers cannot collect or we are required to reduce interchange rates, issuers may be less willing to participate in our four-party
  payments system. Alternatively, they may reduce the benefits associated with our products, choose to charge higher fees to
  consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services, or seek a fee reduction from us to decrease the
  expense of their payment programs (particularly if regulation has a disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors in
  terms of the fees we can charge).

The    RBA     initially capped     credit
interchange, but subsequently capped debit interchange as well.

                                                                      20       When     we cannot     set default interchange reimbursement            rates   at optimal levels, issuers      and acquirers     may
find our payments       system less attractive.     This may increase the        attractiveness of     other payments      systems, such
as our competitors’ closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. We
believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees, or reducing certain benefits to
consumers,      which make our products less          appealing to consumers.         Some     acquirers may      elect  to charge higher
MDR regardless of the Visa interchange reimbursement rate, causing merchants not to accept our products or to
steer customers       to alternative    payments systems         or forms    of payment. In addition, in        an effort   to  reduce   the
expense     of  their payment programs,         some    issuers   and   acquirers have obtained, and may continue                to obtain,
incentives from us, including reductions in the fees that we charge, which directly impacts our revenues.
      In  addition, we are also subject to central bank oversight in a growing                 number of countries, including Brazil,
India,  the   UK   and   within   the  EU.   Some     countries    with  existing   oversight    frameworks      are   looking   to  further
enhance     their  regulatory powers      while   regulators in    other  jurisdictions   are considering      or  adopting   approaches
based    on   these    regulatory    principles.   This   oversight    could    result  in  new    governance,      reporting,   licensing,
cybersecurity,     processing     infrastructure,   capital,   or  credit  risk  management        requirements.     We    could   also   be
required   to  adopt   policies  and   practices    designed    to  mitigate   settlement    and   liquidity risks,  including increased
requirements      to maintain    sufficient   levels   of capital   and   financial   resources     locally, as   well  as  localized    risk
management or governance.             Increased oversight could also          include   new criteria    for  member     participation   and
merchant access to our payments system.

•    Interchange Fees. Interchange fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in
      balancing the costs and benefits that consumers and merchants derive. Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers
      and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred. These costs are incurred by issuers in providing
      services that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants, whose participation in the network
      enables increased sales to their existing and new customers, efficiencies in the delivery of existing and new products, guaranteed
      payments and improved customer experience. ee (or, alternatively, financial institutions) establish “default interchange fees”
      that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer. ee administer the
      collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process.

•    Additional FourOParty System Fees. The merchant discount rate is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of both
     participating in the four-party system and providing services to merchants. The rate takes into consideration the amount of the
     interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer. Additionally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and
     related fees in addition to the merchant discount rate. Issuers may also charge account holders fees for the transaction,
     including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit.
Switched Transactions
•    Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. Through our core payment network, we enable the routing of a transaction to the
     issuer for its approval, facilitate the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a
     successfully conducted transaction, and settle the transaction by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties via
     settlement banks chosen by us and our customers.
•    CrossOBorder and Domestic. Our core payment network switches transactions throughout the world when the merchant country
     and country of issuance are different (“cross-border transactions”), providing account holders with the ability to use, and
     merchants to accept, our products and services across country borders. ee also provide switched transaction services to
     customers where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same (“domestic transactions”).

The potential consequences of U.S. and Canadian merchants choosing to surcharge credit cards, as permitted by the company's new no-surcharge rules, include consumers viewing electronic payment products less favorably and opting for alternative payment methods. This shift could lead to a decrease in overall transaction volumes for electronic payment products, adversely affecting the company's results of operations.

settlement), and includes policies, procedures and requirements related to risk management, collateral, participant default, timely
switching of financial transactions, and capital and financial resources. Parts of our business have also been deemed as a “specified
service provider” or considered “critical infrastructure”. The impact to our business created by any new law, regulation or
designation is magnified by the potential it has to be replicated in, or conflict with, other jurisdictions, or involve other products
within any particular jurisdiction.
The expansion of our products and services as part of our multi-rail strategy has also created the need for us to obtain new types and
increasing numbers of regulatory licenses, resulting in increased supervision and additional compliance burdens distinct from those
imposed on our core payment network activities. For example, certain of our subsidiaries maintain money transfer licenses to
support certain activities.            These licenses typically impose supervisory and examination requirements, as well as capital,
safeguarding, risk management and other business obligations.
Increased regulation and oversight of payments systems, as well as increased exposure to regulation resulting from changes to our
products and services, have resulted and may continue to result in significant compliance and governance burdens or otherwise
increase our costs. As a result, customers could be less willing to participate in our payments system and4or use our other products

We share most of these risks with all businesses.
Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results.
        Over time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues,
regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed, for example, the regulation
of banks and other major financial institutions, the regulation of products and environmental and global-warming matters.
These initiatives impact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a
significant negative impact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have significant, but not
controlling, economic interests. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
        Data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world. These
regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems,
networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant economic
penalties.

                                                                               K-26 Climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions may impact our businesses.
         The impacts of climate change and the regulation of GHG emissions could impact our businesses to varying degrees.
Climate change could cause or intensify hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other extreme weather events that may increase the
physical risks to and impacts on our operations. An increase in the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events and storms
could impact the physical assets of our non-insurance operations and could produce losses affecting our businesses. Similarly,
extreme weather events may produce losses affecting our insurance operations as their primary business is to monitor, assess
and price risk, including climate-related risk, at an expected economic profit to address the risk-transfer needs of their insurance
customers.
         Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge that accelerate the transition to a lower-GHG emitting
economy and could, in turn, increase costs for our businesses to comply with those policies, including BNSF and BHE, which
combined represent more than 90% of Berkshire’s direct emissions. The failure to comply with new or existing regulations or
reinterpretation of existing regulations relating to climate change could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results.

  Please see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for a complete discussion of these risk factors. ee caution you that the important factors
  referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you.

As a global payments technology company, we are subject to                     complex and evolving regulations that govern
our   operations.    See    Item 1—Government          Regulation      for more     information    on   the  most    significant   areas    of
regulation that affect our business. The impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could
limit our  ability  to enforce    our  payments      system    rules;  require   us  to adopt    new   rules  or  change    existing   rules;
affect   our  existing    contractual    arrangements;       increase    our   compliance      costs;   and   require    us  to  make     our
technology or     intellectual property     available to   third  parties, including competitors, in        an undesirable manner.         As
discussed     in  more    detail   below,    we   may    face   differing   rules   and    regulations    in  matters    like  interchange
reimbursement rates,        preferred routing, domestic        processing and localization requirements,            currency conversion,
point-of-sale    transaction     rules   and   practices,    privacy,    data   use   or   protection,    licensing   requirements,      and
associated product technology. As a result,            the Visa    operating rules and our other contractual           commitments may

                                                                      18 differ  from  country    to country    or by product     offering.  Complying      with  these   and   other  regulations increases       our
costs and reduces our revenue opportunities.

      If widely    varying   regulations    come    into  existence    worldwide,     we   may   have    difficulty rapidly   adjusting   our
product offerings,     services,   fees and other important aspects           of our business to      comply with the regulations. Our
compliance     programs     and policies     are  designed to support our        compliance with a       wide array of regulations        and
laws, such as regulations regarding anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, competition,                        money transfer services,
privacy   and   sanctions, and      we  continually    adjust our    compliance programs         as regulations     evolve.   However,     we
cannot    guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities.

Legal and Regulatory
Payments Industry Regulation
Global regulatory and legislative activity related to the payments industry may have a material adverse impact on our overall
business and results of operations.
Central banks and similar regulatory bodies have increasingly established or further expanded their authority over certain aspects of
payments systems such as ours, including obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services that we may
offer, the countries in which our products and services may be used, the way we structure and operate our business and the types of
consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products or services. Similarly, jurisdictions that regulate a particular
product may consider extending their jurisdiction to other products. For example, debit regulations could lead to regulation of credit
products. Woreover, several jurisdictions are demonstrating increased interest about the network fees we charge to our customers
(in some cases as part of broader market reviews of retail payments), which could in the future lead to regulation of our network
fees. In several jurisdictions, we have been designated as a “systemically important payment system”, with other regulators
considering similar designations. This type of regulation and oversight is related to switching activities (authorization, clearing and
settlement), and includes policies, procedures and requirements related to risk management, collateral, participant default, timely
switching of financial transactions, and capital and financial resources. Parts of our business have also been deemed as a “specified
service provider” or considered “critical infrastructure”.

In turn, our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over
 which we have little or no influence, including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by
 competitors or emerging technologies, as well as regulation. If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or
 we may be exposed to settlement risk. See “Risk Factors - Settlement and Third-Party Obligations” in this Part I, Item 1A with
 respect to how we guarantee certain third-party obligations.
 eith the exception of the c.S. and a select number of other jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border) transactions
 conducted using cards with our brands are switched by our customers or other processors. Because we do not provide domestic
 switching services in these countries or have direct relationships with account holders, we depend on our close working relationships
 with our customers to effectively manage our brands, and the perception of our payments system, among consumers in these
 countries. ee also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these
 countries, alongside our own relationships with them. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to
 be in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may materially and adversely impact our business.

Merchants’ continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our
incentive program costs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.
Werchants are important constituents in our payments system. ee rely on both our relationships with them, as well as their
relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers, to continue to expand the acceptance of our products and services. ee also
work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies, increase
revenues and fight fraud. In the retail industry, we believe a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence are
having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including Wastercard. Some large merchants have
supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Wastercard has been defending, including the c.S.
merchant litigations.

Increased regulation and oversight can have several potential impacts on the business's financial performance. These include:

1. **Compliance and Governance Burdens**: New regulations may lead to significant compliance and governance burdens, increasing operational costs.

2. **Customer Participation**: Customers might be less willing to participate in the payments system or use other products and services due to the increased regulatory environment.

3. **Reduced Benefits**: The benefits associated with the use of products may be reduced, making them less desirable to consumers.

4. **Transaction Volume**: There could be a decrease in the volume of domestic and cross-border transactions, which may adversely affect operational metrics.

5. **Profitability and Innovation**: Increased regulation could impact profitability and limit the ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services.

6. **Network Fees**: Regulations regarding network fees charged to customers could materially and adversely impact results of operations.

7. **Approval Requirements**: Regulators may require prior approval for changes to system rules or operations, which could negatively affect the business.

Overall, these factors could lead to a material and adverse impact on the business's financial performance.","Global regulatory and legislative activity can significantly impact the payments industry in several ways:

1. **Compliance and Governance Burdens**: New regulations may increase operational costs due to compliance requirements.

2. **Customer Participation**: An increased regulatory environment might deter customers from participating in the payments system or using certain products and services.

3. **Reduced Benefits**: The advantages associated with using payment products may diminish, making them less appealing to consumers.

4. **Transaction Volume**: There could be a decline in both domestic and cross-border transaction volumes, adversely affecting operational metrics.

5. **Profitability and Innovation**: Heightened regulation may impact profitability and restrict the ability to innovate or offer unique products and services.

Item 1A.

Since Tanuary 2023, the trial court has held hearings on various issues, including
 whether any causal connection existed between the levels of Wastercard’s intra-EEA interchange fees and c.U. domestic interchange
 fees and regarding Wastercard’s request to narrow the number of years of damages sought by the plaintiffs on statute of limitations
 grounds.
 Wastercard has been named as a defendant in a proposed consumer collective action filed in Portugal on behalf of Portuguese
 consumers. The complaint, which seeks to leverage the 2019 resolution of the European Commission’s investigation of Wastercard’s
 central acquiring rules and interregional interchange fees, claims damages of approximately €0.4 billion (approximately $0.4 billion
 as of December 31, 2023) for interchange fees that were allegedly passed on to consumers by Portuguese merchants for a period of
 approximately 20 years. Wastercard has submitted a statement of defense that disputes both liability and damages.
 In April 2023, the Serbian Competition Commission issued a Statement of Objections (“SO”) against Wastercard. The SO covers
 historic domestic interchange fees from 2013 to 201B. The SO seeks monetary fines and costs but no business practices changes.
 Australia.      In Way 2022, the Australian Competition + Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) filed a complaint targeting certain
 agreements entered into by Wastercard and certain Australian merchants related to Wastercard’s debit program. The ACCC alleges
 that by entering into such agreements, Wastercard engaged in conduct with the purpose of substantially lessening competition in
 the supply of debit card acceptance services. The ACCC seeks both declaratory relief and monetary fines and costs. A hearing on
 liability issues has been scheduled for Warch 2025.

regulators and policymakers around the globe use the GDPR as a reference to adopt new or updated privacy, data protection and
information security laws and regulations, although divergences have occurred. Laws and regulations in this area are constantly
evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collection and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents,
more sensitive data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI. In addition, the interpretation and application of these
privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations are often uncertain and in a state of flux, thus requiring
constant monitoring for compliance.

 ESG. darious jurisdictions have adopted or are increasingly considering adopting laws and regulations impacting our reporting on
 ESG governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets, and results. Regulations already adopted or being considered
 include required corporate reporting and disclosures on specific topics as well as broader ESG matters. Specific topics include
 climate (such as the c.U. Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting, the Ec Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, or “Ec
 CSRD”, and the SEC proposed rules related to climate change) and human rights (such as the Ec Corporate Sustainability Due
 Diligence Directive). Broader ESG matters include other environmental matters, treatment of employees and diversity of workforce
 (such as in the Ec CSRD).
 Additional Regulatory Developments. darious regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues that could
 impact us, including evolving laws surrounding buy-now-pay-later, open banking, digital currencies, marijuana, prepaid payroll cards,
 identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules and marketing.

 Additional Information
 Wastercard Incorporated was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in Way 2001. ee conduct our business principally through
 our principal operating subsidiary, Wastercard International Incorporated, a Delaware non-stock (or membership) corporation that
 was formed in November 19;;.

It is unclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay
would be successful.

         We also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data
breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our
regulatory compliance. For example, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard
Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC
issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its
processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the United States. We are
appealing this decision and the corrective orders are currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court. On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed
the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three
additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General as a ""qualifying state"" under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July
10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States
ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the
""Data Privacy Framework List,"" maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy
Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, and we are
implementing steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. For additional information, see Part II, Item 1A, ""Risk
Factors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S.

Additionally,
regulations such as the revised Payment Services Directive (commonly referred to as “PSD2”) in the EEA require financial institutions
to provide third-party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, enabling them to route transactions away from
Wastercard products and provide payment initiation and account information services directly to consumers who use our products.
PSD2 also requires a new standard for authentication of transactions, which necessitates additional verification information from
consumers to complete transactions. This may increase the number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to
ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.
Regulation of Internet, Digital Transactions and High-Risk Merchant Categories. darious jurisdictions have enacted or have
proposed regulation related to internet transactions which applies to payments system participants, including us and our customers.
ee may also be impacted by evolving laws surrounding gambling, including fantasy sports, as well as certain legally permissible but
high-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms, alcohol and tobacco.
Privacy, Data Protection, AI and Information Security. Aspects of our operations or business are subject to increasingly complex
and fragmented privacy, data and information security laws and regulations in the c.S., the Ec and elsewhere around the world. For
example, in the c.S., we and our customers are respectively subject to, among other laws and regulations, Federal Trade
Commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) that
require, among other things, the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program and, increasingly, a
number of state data and privacy laws. eith respect to information security, the c.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”) adopted new disclosure rules that require, among other things, disclosing material cybersecurity incidents in a Current Report
on Form B-U, generally within four business days of determining an incident is material. In the Ec, we are subject to the General

17       In  the UK, Visa Europe        is designated     as a Recognized Payment System, bringing it                within the  scope of    the
Bank    of England’s     supervisory    powers     and   subjecting    it to various    requirements,     including   on   issues   such   as
governance and risk management              designed to maintain        the stability  of the  UK’s financial system. Visa        Europe is
also regulated     by the UK’s     Payment Systems         Regulator (PSR),      which has     wide-ranging powers and authority to
review   our business      practices, systems,      rules and    fees with   respect    to promoting competition        and innovation      in
the  UK, and ensuring       payment systems take care of, and promote, the interests of service-users. Post-Brexit, the
UK   has   adopted various European regulations,             including regulations that impact         the payments      ecosystem, such
as the   IFR and PSD2. The         PSR is responsible       for monitoring Visa Europe’s compliance with the IFR as adopted
in the UK.
      Corporate      Responsibility       and   Sustainability:     Certain    governments      around    the  world   are  adopting    laws
and regulations     pertaining to    corporate responsibility and sustainability          performance, transparency and reporting.
Regulations     may   include mandated        corporate    reporting (e.g.,    Corporate Sustainability       Reporting    Directive)   or  in
individual areas, such as mandated reporting on climate-related financial disclosures.
      Additional      Regulatory      Developments:         Various    regulatory    agencies    across    the   world   also   continue    to
examine     a  wide variety    of  other  issues,    including mobile     payment     transactions,     tokenization,    access    rights  for
non-financial    institutions,   money     transfer   services,    identity  theft,  account     management       guidelines,    disclosure
rules,  security   and marketing       that  could   affect our    financial   institution  clients  and our     business.

Visa   is also
subject   to  oversight   by   banking    and   financial  sector   authorities   in  other  jurisdictions,   such   as Brazil    and   Hong
Kong.

      European and United Kingdom Regulations and Supervisory Oversight: Visa in Europe continues to be
subject to complex and evolving regulation in the EEA and the UK.

      There    are  a  number     of  EU   regulations    that  impact   our   business.    As  discussed     above,    the  IFR   regulates
interchange rates within        the EEA,     requires    Visa   Europe    to  separate    its payment card        scheme activities from
processing     activities  for  accounting,    organization     and   decision-making       purposes    within   the  EEA,    and   imposes
limitations   on   network    exclusivity   and   routing.   National    competent      authorities   in  the  EEA    are  responsible     for
monitoring    and   enforcing    the  IFR   in their  markets.   We    are  also  subject to regulations       governing    areas   such    as
privacy and data protection, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and sanctions. Other regulations in
Europe,    such   as the   second Payment Services Directive             (PSD2), require,      among other things, that        our  financial
institution  clients   provide   certain   customer     account    access    rights  to  emerging     non-financial    institution  players.
PSD2    also   includes strong customer        authentication     requirements      for certain transactions      that could impose      both
operational    complexity     on   Visa   and   impact    consumer      payment     experiences.      Visa   Europe    is  also   subject   to
supervisory oversight by the European Central Bank and certain competent authorities in Europe.

                                                                      17       In  the UK, Visa Europe        is designated     as a Recognized Payment System, bringing it                within the  scope of    the

insurance_documents, Which regions and countries are subject to economic sanctions administered by OFAC as mentioned in the text?,"The economic sanctions programs
administered by OFAC restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies (specifically Crimea,
the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of ckraine, Cuba, Iran, North Uorea and Syria) and with
persons and entities included in OFAC sanctions lists including its list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the
“SDN List”). ee take measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with OFAC and other applicable sanctions, including
establishing a risk-based compliance program that has policies, procedures and controls designed to prevent us from having
unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or entities. As part of this program, we obligate issuers and
acquirers to comply with their local sanctions obligations and c.S. and Ec sanctions programs. In the c.S., these obligations include
requiring the screening of account holders and merchants, respectively, against OFAC sanctions lists (including the SDN List). Iran
and Syria have been identified by the c.S. State Department as terrorist-sponsoring states, and we have no offices, subsidiaries or
affiliated entities located in these countries and do not license entities domiciled there. ee are also subject to anti-corruption laws
and regulations globally, including the c.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the c.U. Bribery Act, which, among other things,
generally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of value for the purpose of improperly influencing a business decision or
to gain an unfair business advantage. ee have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls to proactively manage
corruption risk.
Issuer and Acquirer Practices Legislation and Regulation. Our issuers and acquirers are subject to numerous regulations and
investigations applicable to banks, financial institutions and other licensed entities, impacting us as a consequence. Additionally,
regulations such as the revised Payment Services Directive (commonly referred to as “PSD2”) in the EEA require financial institutions
to provide third-party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, enabling them to route transactions away from
Wastercard products and provide payment initiation and account information services directly to consumers who use our products.
PSD2 also requires a new standard for authentication of transactions, which necessitates additional verification information from
consumers to complete transactions.

This includes obligating
issuers and acquirers to screen account holders and merchants, respectively, against the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets
Control’s (“OFAC”) sanctions lists, including the List of Specially Designated Nationals (“SDN list”).

We identified through our compliance program that for the period covered by this Report:

      •     acquirers located in the Europe and Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa regions each acquired transactions over our
            network for an Iranian airline

      •     during the three months ended March 31, 2023, an acquirer located in the Asia/Pacific region acquired transactions
            over our network for consular services with an Iranian embassy

      •     during the three months ended December 31, 2023, an acquirer located in the Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa
            region acquired transactions over our network for consular services with an Iranian embassy

OFAC regulations and other legal authorities provide exemptions for certain activities involving dealings with Iran. However,
Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 requires us to disclose whether we, or any of our
affiliates, have knowingly engaged in certain transactions or dealings involving the Government of Iran or with certain persons
or entities found on the SDN list, regardless of whether these dealings constitute a violation of OFAC regulations.

We do not calculate net revenues or net profits associated with specific merchants (our customers’ customers). However, we
used our fee schedule and the aggregate number and amount of transactions involving the above merchants to estimate the
net revenue and net profit we obtained with respect to the period covered by this Report. Both the number of transactions
and our estimated net revenue and net profits for this period are de minimis.

Preferential or Protective Government Actions. Some governments have taken action to provide resources, preferential treatment
                  or other protection to selected domestic payments and processing providers, as well as to create their own national providers. For
                  example, governments in some countries mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only
                  domestic companies. Some jurisdictions are currently considering adopting or have adopted “data localization” requirements, which

Furthermore,      regional    groups of    countries,
such as the Gulf      Cooperation Council (GCC) and a number of countries in Southeast Asia (e.g., Malaysia), have
adopted or may consider, efforts to restrict our participation in the processing of regional transactions. The African
Development       Bank has also indicated an         interest in supporting national payment            systems in its efforts to     expand
financial   inclusion   and   strengthen     regional financial     stability. Finally,   some    countries    such   as  South    Africa  are
mandating on-shore processing            of domestic transactions. Geopolitical events, including sanctions, trade tensions
or other types of activities have intensified any or all of these activities, which could adversely affect our business.
For example, in the aftermath of          U.S. and European sanctions against Russia and the decision by U.S. payments
networks,    including Visa     to  suspend     operations in    the country,     some    countries   have expressed        concerns about
their reliance on U.S. financial services companies, including payments networks, and have taken steps to bolster
the development of domestic solutions. Separately, Russia has called for the BRICS countries (a five-country bloc
made    up   of Brazil,  Russia,    India, China    and South     Africa, and    which recently      extended    invitations   to Argentina,
Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran,      Saudi Arabia, and the        United Arab Emirates), to        lessen dependence on Western payments
systems by, among other things, integrating payments systems and cards across member countries.
       Central banks     in a number of      countries, including those in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Brazil, Europe                    and
Mexico, are     in the  process of developing or expanding national RTP networks and instant                       payment solutions with
the goal   of driving a greater number of domestic             transactions onto these systems. In July 2023, the U.S. Federal
Reserve launched        its FedNow Service with          core  clearing   and settlement      functionality, and     expects    to add   more
features    and   enhancements        over   time.   Some     countries    are  also   exploring    cross-border      connectivity    of  their

       •   In October 2023, the c.S. Federal Reserve issued a
           proposal that would lower the interchange rate cap
           for debit and prepaid transactions in the c.S. by
           approximately 2B%-30% (based on an average ticket
           size of $50), with the cap automatically updating
           every two years.


       •   In Tune 2023, legislation was re-introduced in the c.S.
           Senate that would extend routing mandates for

           limitations on the collection, use and retention of
           covered data).


       •   In October 2023, Wastercard was designated by the
           Bank of Canada (BoC) as a “prominent payment
           system” as it relates to its business in Canada (i.e., a
           payment system that is critical for economic activity in
           Canada). This designation will result in broad
           regulatory oversight by the BoC.


                  Preferential or Protective Government Actions. Some governments have taken action to provide resources, preferential treatment
                  or other protection to selected domestic payments and processing providers, as well as to create their own national providers. For
                  example, governments in some countries mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only
                  domestic companies.

The regions and countries subject to economic sanctions administered by OFAC, as mentioned in the text, are Crimea, the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria.","Some actions taken by governments to protect or support domestic payments and processing providers include:

1. **Mandating Domestic Payment Switching**: Some governments require that domestic payments be processed entirely within their country or only by domestic companies.

2. **Data Localization Requirements**: Certain jurisdictions are considering or have adopted data localization mandates, which require the collection, storage, and processing of data within their borders. Countries like India, China, and Saudi Arabia are examples.

3. **Support for National Payment Systems**: Regional groups, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and countries in Southeast Asia, are considering efforts to restrict foreign participation in regional transaction processing.

4. **Onshore Processing Mandates**: Some countries, like South Africa, are mandating that domestic transactions be processed onshore.

5. **Development of National Real-Time Payment (RTP) Networks**: Central banks in various countries are developing or expanding national RTP networks and instant payment solutions to increase domestic transaction volumes.

6. **Integration of Payment Systems**: Countries, particularly within the BRICS bloc, are looking to lessen dependence on Western payment systems by integrating their payment systems and cards.

insurance_documents,What action did the c.S. Federal Reserve propose in October 2023 regarding the interchange rate cap for debit and prepaid transactions?,"For example,      in  October    2022, the
          Federal    Reserve published a final        rule effectively   requiring issuers to ensure that at         least two unaffiliated
          networks     are available for    routing card    not   present   debit transactions     by July 1, 2023.      In October 2023,
          the  Federal    Reserve     issued   a proposal for     comment      which would     further   lower  debit interchange rates,
          with a mechanism for automatic adjustment every two years. Separately, there continues to be interest in
          regulation    of credit interchange      fees and routing practices by members of Congress and state legislators
          in the  U.S. In June 2023, legislation was reintroduced in the U.S.                House of     Representatives and Senate,
          which among other         things, would require large issuing         banks to offer    a choice of    at  least two unaffiliated
          networks     over  which electronic      credit transactions may       be  processed. Similar legislation was          introduced
          in  the  previous    Congress     in  2022   but   failed  to advance     and   become      law.  The   current   legislation   has
          additional    bipartisan    support,   and    while   the  ultimate   outcome      of  the  legislation   remains     unclear,    its
          sponsors continue to strongly advocate for its passage.

                                                                      19       •   In Europe, the EU’s IFR places an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees

          respectively). EU      member      states  have the     ability to further   reduce    these   interchange    levels   within their
          territories. The European Commission has announced its intention to conduct another impact assessment
          of the IFR, which could result in even lower caps on               interchange rates and the expansion of regulation to
          other types of products, services and fees.

           proposal that would lower the interchange rate cap
           for debit and prepaid transactions in the c.S. by
           approximately 2B%-30% (based on an average ticket
           size of $50), with the cap automatically updating
           every two years.


       •   In Tune 2023, legislation was re-introduced in the c.S.

                  Preferential or Protective Government Actions. Some governments have taken action to provide resources, preferential treatment

                  example, governments in some countries mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only
                  domestic companies.

Regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate                         various aspects
of the payments industry. See Item           1—Government Regulation for more information. In the U.S. and many                         other
jurisdictions,   we  have historically set default interchange           reimbursement       fees. Even     though we generally       do not
receive any revenue        related to interchange      reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (in                the context of credit
and   debit   transactions,     those   fees   are   paid  by   the  acquirers    to  the   issuers;   the  reverse    is  true  for  certain
transactions    like ATM), interchange reimbursement fees               are  a factor on which we compete with             other payments
providers and      are  therefore   an important     determinant     of  the  volume    of  transactions    we   process.    Consequently,
changes to these fees, whether voluntarily or by mandate, can substantially affect our                        overall  payments volumes
and revenues.

      Interchange      reimbursement       fees,   certain operating     rules and     related   practices    continue    to be   subject   to
increased government regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions
have reviewed or are reviewing these fees, rules and practices. For example:
      •   Regulations      adopted      by   the   U.S.    Federal     Reserve      cap    the   maximum        U.S.   debit    interchange
          reimbursement rate        received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction,
          plus a possible fraud adjustment of           1 cent. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act limits issuers’ and our ability
          to adopt    network    exclusivity and preferred routing in         the debit and    prepaid area,     which also     impacts   our
          business. In response to merchant requests,              the Federal Reserve has recently taken             actions to revisit its
          regulations    that   implement     these   aspects    of  the  Dodd-Frank       Act.  For example,      in  October    2022, the
          Federal    Reserve published a final        rule effectively   requiring issuers to ensure that at         least two unaffiliated

Such authority has resulted in regulation of
Wastercard as financial market infrastructure, as well as regulation
related to various aspects of our business (including areas such as
consumer protections and cybersecurity). In the European cnion
(the “Ec”), Wastercard is subject to systemic importance regulation,
which includes various requirements we must meet, including
obligations related to governance and risk management. In the
c.U., the Bank of England designated docalink™, our real-time
account-based payments network platform, as a “specified service
provider”, and Wastercard as a “recognized payment system”,
which includes supervisions and examination requirements.
addition, Ec legislation requires us to separate our scheme activities
(brand, products, franchise and licensing) from our switching
activities and other processing in terms of how we go to market,
make decisions and organize our structure.                     Examples of other
markets where Wastercard is formally overseen include Australia,
Brazil, India, Wexico and South Africa. Additionally, certain of our
subsidiaries are also regulated as payments institutions, including as
money transmitters.             This regulation subjects us to licensing
obligations, regulatory supervision and examinations, as well as
various business conduct and risk management requirements.
Interchange Fees. Interchange fees that support the function and
value of four-party payments systems like ours are being reviewed
or challenged around the world via legislation to regulate
interchange fees, competition-related regulatory proceedings,
central bank regulation and litigation. Examples include statutes in
the c.S. that cap debit interchange for certain regulated activities,
proposed legislation in the c.S. to extend routing mandates to
credit, our settlement with the European Commission (the “EC”)
resolving its investigation into our interregional interchange fees
and the Ec legislation capping consumer credit and debit
interchange fees on payments issued and acquired within the
European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For more detail, see “Risk

insurance_documents," What are some competitive advantages mentioned for the company in the text?

","The Company faces substantial competition in
these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital
content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of
active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have
the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have
from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.

Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or
collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate
the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.

The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established
service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes
with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.

The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and
services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services
that compete effectively.

Business Risks

To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products
and services.
Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new
products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and
services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services.

The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.

applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or
collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.

Supply of Components
Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from
single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,
tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times
subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize
custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the
suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,
may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s
requirements.

The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or
renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.

Research and Development
Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully
depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace.

•  It is not clear what the full intent of the Basel
   III endgame was — it will have unintended con-
   sequences. Without real analysis of expected
   outcomes, additional regulation will likely
   reduce the number of banks offering certain
   services and increase costs for all market partic-
   ipants and activity, including loans, market
   making and hedging (by farmers, airlines and
   countries, among others). And new rules might
   even increase consolidation as companies race
   to achieve economies of scale in certain prod-
   ucts and services.


                                                         UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY  31 Unfortunately, some recent regulations are ending
up in court. You can imagine that no one wants to
sue their regulators. Banks would not sue if they did
not think they were right — or if they thought they
had any other recourse — which they effectively do
not. This is definitely not what anyone should want.
A more constructive relationship with regulators
would reduce confusion and uncertainty and would
lead to better outcomes for banks, their sharehold-
ers, and their clients, customers and communities.

Collaboration between banks and regulators
could improve the use of resources and create
better outcomes.
True collaboration could dramatically improve the
banking system. For example:

• Redirect enormous resources from things that
  don’t matter to things that do. As mentioned, it
  takes 80,000 pages to describe a CCAR test and
  80,000 pages to detail recovery and resolution.
  The talent and resources at the banks and
  regulators could be better used elsewhere.
  Such overload is distracting and takes your eye
  off the ball on real, emerging risks, including
  China, trade, payment systems and cybersecu-
  rity, among others.
• Reduce bureaucratic processes that provoke a
  tendency to herd mentality. For example, CCAR
  is just a point-in-time stress test, and it can lull
  you into a false sense of security — for refer-
  ence, we do more than 100 stress tests each
  week. On interest rate exposure, focusing on
  the documentation of details may stop you from
  thinking about big interest rate exposure.
  Sometimes analyzing “what ifs” and fat tail risks
  is better than excessive and rigid models and
  documentations.

Business Risks

We face intense competition in our industry.

       The   global   payments     space    is  intensely   competitive.     As  technology      evolves   and    consumer     expectations
change,    new competitors       or methods      of payment     emerge, and existing        clients and   competitors assume different
roles.  Our products      compete     with cash,    checks, electronic      payments, virtual     currency    payments, global       or multi-
regional   networks,     other  domestic     and   closed-loop    payments      systems,    digital  wallets and     alternative   payments
providers    primarily    focused    on   enabling    payments      through    ecommerce       and    mobile    channels.    As   the   global
payments      space    becomes      more    complex,     we   face   increasing     competition     from   our   clients,  other   emerging
payment      providers    such    as   fintechs,    other   digital  payments,      technology      companies       that  have    developed
payments systems enabled through               online activity in ecommerce,         social media, and mobile channels, as well             as
governments       in  a  number     of  jurisdictions   (e.g.,  Brazil   and   India)   as   discussed     above,    that  are   developing,
supporting and/or operating national schemes, RTP networks and other payment platforms.

       Our  competitors     may    acquire,   develop,    or  make    better   use   of substantially    better   technology,    have    more
widely   adopted delivery channels, or          have greater financial resources. They            may offer    more effective, innovative
or  a  wider  range    of programs,      products    and  services.    They   may    use   more   effective   advertising    and   marketing
strategies    that  result   in broader    brand    recognition,    and    greater   use,   including    with  respect    to  issuance     and
merchant     acceptance. They may          also  develop    better security    solutions    or more favorable       pricing  arrangements.

In addition to local and regional networks, national governments continue to explore the use of central
      bank digital currencies (“CBDCs”).
 •    Digital Currencies. Stablecoins and floating cryptocurrencies may become more popular as they become more regulated and
      increasingly viewed as providing immediacy, 244A accessibility, immutability and efficiency. Some players, including payment
      service providers and payment facilitators, have started to enable merchant acceptance of such currencies in P2W, while some
      banks have started experimenting with blockchain B2B payments. Digital currencies and emerging players (such as crypto
      natives) have the ability to disrupt traditional financial markets. The increased prominence of digital currencies creates an
      opportunity for us but could equally compete with our products and services.
 •    ValueOAdded Service Providers and New Network Capabilities Players. ee face competition from companies that provide
      alternatives to our value-added services and solutions. These companies include information services and consulting firms that
      provide consulting services and insights to financial institutions, merchants and governments, technology companies that
      provide cyber and fraud solutions (including AI-based solutions), and companies that compete against us as providers of loyalty
      and program management solutions. ee also face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our open banking
      and digital identity solutions. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in this space.

 •    Industry participants continue to invest in and develop alternative capabilities, such as account-based payments, which could
      facilitate P2W transactions that compete with both our core payment network and our additional payment capabilities.
 •    Regulation (such as PSD2 in the EEA) may disintermediate issuers by enabling third-party providers opportunities to route
      payment transactions away from our network and products and towards other forms of payment by offering account
      information or payment initiation services directly to those who currently use our products. Such regulation may also provide
      these processors with the opportunity to commoditize the data that are included in the transactions they are servicing. If our
      customers are disintermediated in their business, we could face diminished demand for our products and services.
 •    Although we partner with fintechs and technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) that leverage our
      technology, platforms and networks to deliver their products, they could develop platforms or networks that disintermediate us
      from digital payments and impact our ability to compete in the digital economy. These companies may also develop products or
      services that compete with our customers within the payments ecosystem and, as a result, could diminish demand for our
      products and services. ehen we do partner with fintechs and technology companies, we face a heightened risk when we share
      data as part of those relationships. ehile we share this data in a controlled manner subject to applicable anonymization and

      P2W and P2P market share.

Certain of our competitors have developed alternative payments systems, e-commerce payments systems and payments systems for
mobile devices, as well as physical store locations. A number of these competitors rely principally on technology to support their
services that provides cost advantages, and as a result may enjoy lower costs than we do. Wany of these competitors are also able
to use existing payment networks without being subject to many of the associated costs. Woreover, these competitors also occupy
various roles in the payments ecosystem that enable them to influence payment choice of other participants. Any of these factors
could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
Our ability to compete may also be affected by regulatory and legislative initiatives, as well as the outcomes of litigation,
competition-related regulatory proceedings and both central bank and legislative activity.
If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive value for our customers and4or effectively align our
resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats. Our failure to compete
effectively against any of the foregoing threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.

ITEW 1A. RISU FACTORS

 Disintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business.
 As the payments industry continues to develop and change, we face disintermediation and related risks, includingD
 •    Parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position as an intermediary in the payment
      process. For example, merchants could switch (and in some cases are switching) transactions directly with issuers. Additionally,
      processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers. Large scale consolidation within processors could
      result in these processors developing bilateral agreements or in some cases switching the entire transaction on their own
      network, thereby disintermediating us.
 •    Industry participants continue to invest in and develop alternative capabilities, such as account-based payments, which could
      facilitate P2W transactions that compete with both our core payment network and our additional payment capabilities.

          and another focusing on increases in the UK in what are referred to as scheme and processing fees.
      •   As   referenced above,       with increased     lobbying by merchants         and other industry      participants, we are also
          beginning     to see   regulatory    interest  in  network    fees  in  the  UK,   Europe    and   Chile.  In  addition, industry

          network    rules,  including   Visa’s restrictions    on cross-border      acquiring.    Other countries,     like New    Zealand,
          are   adopting    regulations    that  require   us  to  seek   government      pre-approval     of  our  network    rules,  which
          could also impact the way we operate in certain markets.
      •   Government       regulations    or  pressure    may    also  impact    our  rules   and   practices   and   require   us   to allow
          other payments networks to support Visa products or services, to have the other network’s functionality or
          brand marks on       our  products, or     to share   our  intellectual property with other       networks. As innovations in
          payment      technology     have    enabled     us  to   expand    into   new    products    and    services,   they    have   also
          expanded      the   potential   scope    of  regulatory     influence.   For   instance,    new    products     and   capabilities,
          including    tokenization,    push   payments,     and   new    flows  (e.g.,  Visa   B2B   Connect) could       bring  increased
          licensing    or  authorization     requirements      in  the   countries    where    the   product    or  capability   is  offered.

The document mentions that the global payments space is intensely competitive, with emerging payment providers such as fintechs and digital payment technology companies competing against traditional players. These new entrants are focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels. Additionally, the document highlights that governments in various jurisdictions are developing national schemes and payment platforms, which also contribute to the competition. 

Examples of traditional electronic payment competitors include Visa, American Express, Discover, JCB, and Mastercard. However, the document does not provide specific names of emerging payment providers.","Wastercard faces competitive pressures from various sources in the payments network industry. Key competitors include traditional payment networks such as Visa, American Express, Discover, and China UnionPay, which offer a range of card-based payment products. Some of these competitors have greater market share in certain regions and may have business models that provide advantages in pricing or regulatory compliance.

Additionally, Wastercard competes with local debit networks and alternative payment systems, including real-time account-based payment systems. These competitors often leverage technology to reduce costs, which can put Wastercard at a disadvantage. The document also notes that regulatory and legislative initiatives, as well as potential disintermediation from stakeholders, could further impact Wastercard's ability to compete effectively.

Emerging payment providers, particularly in the fintech and digital payment sectors, are also intensifying competition by focusing on e-commerce and mobile payment solutions. Furthermore, government initiatives to develop national payment schemes and platforms add another layer of competitive pressure.

insurance_documents, What are the two categories into which the net revenues from contracts with customers are classified?,"Revenue recognion. We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their
respective obligations, each party’s rights can be identiﬁed, payment terms can be identiﬁed, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will
collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisﬁed by transferring control of
a promised product or service to a customer.
       Nature of Products and Services
       Our products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services. The following is a description of the principal
activities from which we generate revenue.
       Products. We recognize revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the customer. Rebates and incentives oﬀered to
distributors, which are earned when sales to end customers are completed, are estimated at the point of revenue recognition. We have elected to exclude from
the transaction price any taxes collected from a customer and to account for shipping and handling activities performed after a customer obtains control of the
product as activities to fulﬁll the promise to transfer the product. From time to time, certain customers agree to pay us secure supply fees in exchange for
prioritized fulﬁllment of product orders. Such fees are included in the transaction price of the product orders and are recognized as revenue in the period that
control over the products is transferred to the customer.
       Subscripons and services. Our subscriptions and services revenue consists of sales and royalties from software arrangements, support services,
professional services, transfer of IP, and non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) arrangements.
       Revenue from software arrangements primarily consists of fees, which may be paid either at contract inception or in

                                                                                                          58 Table of Contents

installments over the contract term, that provide customers with a right to use the software, access general support and maintenance, and utilize our
professional services.
       Our software licenses have standalone functionality from which customers derive beneﬁt, and the customer obtains control of the software when it is
delivered or made available for download. We believe that for the majority of software arrangements, customers derive signiﬁcant beneﬁt from the ongoing
support we provide.

Premiums for life
         reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums for periodic payment annuity
         contracts are fully received and earned at the inception of the contracts. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded
         to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under
         such contracts.
                 Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or service
         is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration
         we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.
                 We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts
         provide customers with products directly or through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified
         under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts
         may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance
         obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or
         service.
                 Sales revenues reflect reductions for returns, allowances, late delivery penalties, volume discounts and other
         incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenues include
         certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon
         us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenues exclude sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing
         authorities. Sales revenues include consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the
         customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control
         has passed to the customer as sales revenue.
                 Product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the
         customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the
         arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, relating to certain
         bridge and structural steel, castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these
         contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured.

recognized net of rebates and incentives provided to customers. Rebates and incentives can be either fixed or variable and are
attributed to the category of revenue to which they pertain.

Payment network
Wastercard’s payment network involves four participants in addition to the CompanyD account holders (a person or entity who holds
a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuers (the account holders’ financial institutions), merchants and acquirers
(the merchants’ financial institutions). Revenue from the Company’s payment network is primarily generated by charging fees to
customers (issuers, acquirers and other market participants) for providing switching and other network-related services, as well as
by charging fees to customers based primarily on the gross dollar volume of activity (GDd, which includes both domestic and cross-
border volume) on the cards that carry the Company’s brands. As a payments network service provider, the Company provides its
customers with continuous access to its global payments network and stands ready to provide transaction processing over the
contractual term. Consideration is variable and is recognized as revenue in the period in which volumes and transactions occur.

Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional
restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and
changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business
practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.

The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press
statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or
international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In
addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.

In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific
obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial
data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding
the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data
is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to
litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.

Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised,
the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry
data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment
cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of
operations and financial condition.

24       UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY •  Supplier diversity. In 2023, our firm spent
   approximately $2.3 billion directly with diverse
   suppliers — an increase of 10% over 2022. As a
   part of our racial equity commitment, over $450
   million was spent in 2023 with more than 190
   Black-, Hispanic- and Latino-owned businesses.
•  Minority depository institutions and commu-
   nity development financial institutions. To
   date, we have invested more than $110 million in
   equity in diverse financial institutions and pro-
   vided over $260 million in incremental financing
   to community development financial institutions
   to support communities that lack access to tradi-
   tional financing. JPMorgan Chase also helped
   these institutions build their capacity so they
   can provide a greater number of critical services
   like mortgages and small business loans.
We’re thoughtfully continuing our diversity,
equity and inclusion efforts.

Of course, JPMorgan Chase will conform as the
laws evolve. We will scour our programs, our words
and our actions to make sure they comply.
That said, we think all the efforts mentioned
above will remain largely unchanged. And, in fact,
around the world, cities and communities where
we do business applaud these efforts. We also
believe our initiatives make us a more inclusive
company and lead to more innovation, smarter
decisions and better financial results for us and
for the economy overall.
We are often asked in particular about “equity”
and what that word means. To us, it means equal
treatment, equal opportunity and equal access …
not equal outcomes. There is nothing wrong with
acknowledging and trying to bridge social and eco-
nomic gaps, whether they be around wealth or
health. We would like to provide a fair chance for
everyone to succeed — regardless of their back-
ground. And we want to make sure everyone who
works at our company feels welcome.
We want to articulate how we weigh in on
social issues and what it means for our
customers.
Before I comment about culture issues, I have a
confession to make: I am a full-throated, red-
blooded, patriotic, free-enterprise (properly regu-
lated, of course) and free-market capitalist.

Many attributes of our business contribute to the objective. The more significant include:
competitive compensation and benefits for those working in our membership warehouses and
distributions channels; a commitment to promoting from within; and a target ratio of at least 50% of our
employee base being full-time employees. These attributes contribute to what we consider, especially for
the industry, a high retention rate. In 2023, in the U.S. that rate was approximately 90% for employees
who have been with us for at least one year.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
The commitment to “Take Care of Our Employees” is also the foundation of our approach to promoting
diversity, equity and inclusion and creating an inclusive and respectful workplace. We strive for an
environment where all employees feel that they belong, are accepted, included, respected and supported
because of who they are. We demonstrate leadership commitment to equity through consistent
communication, employee development and education, support of diversity and inclusion initiatives within
the organization, community involvement, and supplier diversity. Costco continues its efforts to develop
future leaders, including through the supervisor in training programs. In 2023, over 7,800 hourly
employees completed the 6-week course.
Well Being
Costco strives to provide our employees with competitive wages and excellent benefits. In March 2023,
we increased the top of the wage scales by 85 cents per hour in the U.S, Canada and Puerto Rico. In

retain the best talent. Our total rewards programs are based on the principles of paying for performance, paying competitively
versus peer companies that we compete with for talent in the marketplace and focusing on long-term success through a
combination of short-term and long-term incentive programs.

Our core values—integrity, excellence, and respect for people—shape our approach to attracting, retaining,
engaging, and developing a diverse and highly skilled and ethical workforce, which is critical to executing our
strategy. We believe the strength of our workforce significantly contributes to our financial performance and
enables us to make life better for people around the world. For instance, most of the products we sell today were
discovered or developed by our own scientists, and our long-term success depends on our ability to continually
discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative medicines. We believe that fostering a positive
culture that values the contributions of our talented colleagues helps drive our success.
We are committed to creating a safe, supportive, ethical, and rewarding work environment through strategic
focus on our human capital management process, fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices,
robust training and development opportunities, and competitive pay and benefits. We believe our dedication to
promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within our company reflects our values and is a key driver of business
success and growth.
We regularly conduct confidential employee surveys to seek feedback from our workforce on a variety of topics.
These results are reviewed and analyzed by our leaders to identify opportunities to adjust our policies and
benefits to improve our employees' experience. As a result of our efforts, we believe that we have a highly
performing, cohesive workforce and that our employee relations are good.
At the end of 2023, we employed approximately 43,000 people, including approximately 23,000 employees
outside the U.S. Our employees include approximately 10,000 people engaged in research and development
activities.
Strategy and Oversight
We are committed to fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices, and we deeply value diverse
backgrounds, skills, and global perspectives. Because dedication to human capital management is also a core
component of our corporate governance, our board of directors regularly engages with management and
facilitates a system of reporting designed to monitor human capital management initiatives and progress as part
of the overarching framework that guides how we attract, retain, engage, and develop a workforce that aligns
with our values and mission.

us to reputational damage and4or lawsuits involving payment products carrying our brands. Damage to our reputation or that of our
brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems and networks or the systems and networks of our customers,
merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our products and services. Such events could also slow
or reverse the trend toward electronic payments. In addition to reputational concerns, the cumulative impact of multiple account
data compromise events could increase the impact of the fraud resulting from such events by, among other things, making it more
difficult to identify consumers. Woreover, while most of the lawsuits resulting from account data breaches do not involve direct
claims against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers, we could still face damage claims, which, if upheld,
could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. ehile we offer cyber and intelligence products that are designed to
prevent, detect and respond to fraud and cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that such security solutions will perform as
expected or address all possible security threats. Real or perceived defects, failures, errors or vulnerabilities in our security
solutions, such as our cyber and intelligence products, could adversely impact our reputation, customer confidence in our solutions
and our business and may subject us to litigation, governmental audits and investigation or other liabilities. Such events could have
a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes, results of operations and prospects for future growth, or increase our costs
by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed on us.
In addition, fraudulent activity and increasing cyber-attacks have encouraged legislative and regulatory intervention, and could
damage our reputation and reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services or increase our compliance costs. Criminals
are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture consumer personal information to engage in illegal activities such as
counterfeiting or other fraud and may see their effectiveness enhanced by the use of AI.

Woreover, we use our AI and data analytics, along with our cyber risk assessment capabilities, to help enable financial institutions,
                  merchants, corporations and governments to secure their digital assets across each of these five layers.
                  ee have also worked with our customers to provide products to consumers globally with increased confidence through the benefit
                  of “zero liability”, where the consumer bears no responsibility for counterfeit or lost card losses in the event of fraud.

insurance_documents,What measures does Wastercard use to help banks and merchants verify the authenticity of consumers during the payment process?,"Wastercard connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and
other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic forms of payment and making those payment transactions safe, simple, smart
and accessible. The Company makes payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and
services through its family of well-known and trusted brands, including Wastercard®, Waestro® and Cirrus®. The Company operates
a multi-rail payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and Wastercard customers. Through its
unique and proprietary core global payments network, the Company switches (authorizes, clears and settles) payment transactions.
The Company has additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACR”) transactions (both batch and real-
time account-based payments). csing these capabilities, the Company offers payment products and services and captures new
payment flows. The Company’s value-added services include, among others, cyber and intelligence solutions designed to allow all
parties to transact securely, easily and with confidence, as well as other services that provide proprietary insights, drawing on
Wastercard’s principled and responsible use of secure consumer and merchant data. The Company’s investments in new networks,
such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen payments and services solutions. Each of the
Company’s capabilities support and build upon each other and are fundamentally interdependent. For the core global payments
network, Wastercard’s franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and
allows for interoperability among them. The Company employs a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments
ecosystem in which it operates.
Wastercard is not a financial institution. The Company does not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from
interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with
merchants’ acceptance of the Company’s products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, the
Company’s financial institution customers.

data   to protect the    underlying    account    information.    This  security   technology     can   work   for a  variety  of  payment
transactions, both in person or online.
      The    provisioning    of  network     tokens    continues    to  accelerate.     As   of the   end   of   fiscal year   2023,    Visa
provisioned     more than 7.5 billion      network     tokens,   surpassing     the  number     of physical    cards   in circulation.   The
milestone reinforces Visa’s commitment to secure, reliable and efficient money movement, in person and online.

                                                                      8                Click to Pay
      Click to Pay    provides    a simplified and more       consistent cardholder      checkout    experience online by removing
time-consuming       key  entry   of personal    information    and   enabling consumer        and transaction      data   to be passed
securely    between     payments     network     participants.   Based    on   the  EMV®     Secure     Remote     Commerce       industry
standard, Click to     Pay brings    a standardized     and streamlined approach to          online checkout and meets         the needs
of consumers shopping across a growing number of connected devices. The goal of Click to Pay is to make digital
payments as secure, reliable and interoperable as the checkout experience in person.
New Flows
      New flows focus on facilitating commercial and global money movement across Visa’s network of                             networks.
This  approach creates        opportunities to capture new sources            of  money movement through            card   and non-card
flows  for consumers,       businesses and governments            around    the world    by  facilitating  P2P, B2C, B2B        and   G2C
payments.

Wastercard leverages several technologies to secure transactions, including:

1. **Tokenization**: This technology helps protect sensitive payment information by replacing it with a unique identifier or token.

2. **Biometrics**: Various biometric technologies, such as fingerprint, face, and iris scanning, are used to verify the authenticity of consumers during the payment process.

3. **Machine Learning**: This technology is employed to analyze transaction patterns and detect fraudulent behavior.

4. **Cybersecurity Solutions**: Wastercard offers identity, cyber, and consulting services, including transaction monitoring and anti-money laundering detection capabilities.

5. **Multi-layered Safety Strategy**: This includes layers for prevention, detection, and experience, which enhance security across the payments ecosystem.

6. **AI and Data Analytics**: These tools help financial institutions and merchants secure their digital assets and respond to cyber risks effectively.

These technologies collectively contribute to securing transactions and preventing fraud in the payments ecosystem.","In 2023, Wastercard marked the tenth anniversary of introducing token standards to the payments industry and achieved the milestone of processing three billion tokens in one month.",NYSE_MA_2023.pdf_22 and NYSE_MA_2023.pdf_24 and NYSE_V_2023.pdf_31,2024-09-20 18:22:23

Wastercard connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and
other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic forms of payment and making those payment transactions safe, simple, smart
and accessible. The Company makes payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and
services through its family of well-known and trusted brands, including Wastercard®, Waestro® and Cirrus®. The Company operates
a multi-rail payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and Wastercard customers. Through its
unique and proprietary core global payments network, the Company switches (authorizes, clears and settles) payment transactions.
The Company has additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACR”) transactions (both batch and real-
time account-based payments). csing these capabilities, the Company offers payment products and services and captures new
payment flows. The Company’s value-added services include, among others, cyber and intelligence solutions designed to allow all
parties to transact securely, easily and with confidence, as well as other services that provide proprietary insights, drawing on
Wastercard’s principled and responsible use of secure consumer and merchant data. The Company’s investments in new networks,
such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen payments and services solutions. Each of the
Company’s capabilities support and build upon each other and are fundamentally interdependent. For the core global payments
network, Wastercard’s franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and
allows for interoperability among them. The Company employs a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments
ecosystem in which it operates.
Wastercard is not a financial institution. The Company does not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from
interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with
merchants’ acceptance of the Company’s products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, the
Company’s financial institution customers.

      wallet providers, point-of-sale financing4buy-now-pay-later providers, mobile operator services, mobile phone-based money
      transfer and microfinancing services, handset manufacturers, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable providers.
 •    GovernmentOBacked Networks. Governments have been increasingly creating and expanding local payments structures (such as
      the Brazilian Instant Payment System-PIf, FedNow in the c.S. and cnited Payments Interface (cPI) in India), which are
      increasingly being considered as alternatives to traditional domestic payment solutions and schemes such as ours. In particular,
      India has recently engaged in a series of efforts to expand the interoperability and cross-border reach of cPI globally. Wost
      recently, it announced an agreement in 2023 to partner with the cnited Arab Emirates (cAE) to enable Indian travelers within
      the cAE to pay with cPI. In addition to local and regional networks, national governments continue to explore the use of central
      bank digital currencies (“CBDCs”).
 •    Digital Currencies. Stablecoins and floating cryptocurrencies may become more popular as they become more regulated and
      increasingly viewed as providing immediacy, 244A accessibility, immutability and efficiency.

insurance_documents,What role do interchange fees play in the payment system?,"•    Interchange Fees. Interchange fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in
      balancing the costs and benefits that consumers and merchants derive. Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers
      and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred. These costs are incurred by issuers in providing
      services that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants, whose participation in the network
      enables increased sales to their existing and new customers, efficiencies in the delivery of existing and new products, guaranteed
      payments and improved customer experience. ee (or, alternatively, financial institutions) establish “default interchange fees”
      that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer. ee administer the
      collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process.

•    Additional FourOParty System Fees. The merchant discount rate is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of both
     participating in the four-party system and providing services to merchants. The rate takes into consideration the amount of the
     interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer. Additionally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and
     related fees in addition to the merchant discount rate. Issuers may also charge account holders fees for the transaction,
     including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit.
Switched Transactions
•    Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. Through our core payment network, we enable the routing of a transaction to the
     issuer for its approval, facilitate the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a
     successfully conducted transaction, and settle the transaction by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties via
     settlement banks chosen by us and our customers.
•    CrossOBorder and Domestic. Our core payment network switches transactions throughout the world when the merchant country
     and country of issuance are different (“cross-border transactions”), providing account holders with the ability to use, and
     merchants to accept, our products and services across country borders. ee also provide switched transaction services to
     customers where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same (“domestic transactions”).

Regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate                         various aspects
of the payments industry. See Item           1—Government Regulation for more information. In the U.S. and many                         other
jurisdictions,   we  have historically set default interchange           reimbursement       fees. Even     though we generally       do not
receive any revenue        related to interchange      reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (in                the context of credit
and   debit   transactions,     those   fees   are   paid  by   the  acquirers    to  the   issuers;   the  reverse    is  true  for  certain
transactions    like ATM), interchange reimbursement fees               are  a factor on which we compete with             other payments
providers and      are  therefore   an important     determinant     of  the  volume    of  transactions    we   process.    Consequently,
changes to these fees, whether voluntarily or by mandate, can substantially affect our                        overall  payments volumes
and revenues.

      Interchange      reimbursement       fees,   certain operating     rules and     related   practices    continue    to be   subject   to
increased government regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions
have reviewed or are reviewing these fees, rules and practices. For example:
      •   Regulations      adopted      by   the   U.S.    Federal     Reserve      cap    the   maximum        U.S.   debit    interchange
          reimbursement rate        received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction,
          plus a possible fraud adjustment of           1 cent. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act limits issuers’ and our ability
          to adopt    network    exclusivity and preferred routing in         the debit and    prepaid area,     which also     impacts   our
          business. In response to merchant requests,              the Federal Reserve has recently taken             actions to revisit its
          regulations    that   implement     these   aspects    of  the  Dodd-Frank       Act.  For example,      in  October    2022, the
          Federal    Reserve published a final        rule effectively   requiring issuers to ensure that at         least two unaffiliated
          networks     are available for    routing card    not   present   debit transactions     by July 1, 2023.

ee enable transactions for our

 Payment Network Transactions. Our core payment network supports what is often referred to as a “four-party” payments network
 and includes the following participantsD account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for
 payment), issuer (the account holder’s financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution).
 ee do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by
 issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our products. In most cases,
 account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.

 In a typical transaction, an account holder purchases goods or services from a merchant using one of our payment products. After
 the transaction is authorized by the issuer, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the
 interchange fee (described below) and other applicable fees, and then posts the transaction to the account holder’s account. The
 acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the “merchant discount” rate), to the merchant.

insurance_documents,"What are the three pillars of the company's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) priorities","11 Environmental  Social and Governance (""ESG"") Priorities
Our ESG strategy is centered on the concept of creating shared value: we believe we maximize long term value and create
competitive advantage for the Company by serving our stakeholders  including our customers  associates  shareholders
suppliers  business partners and communities  We believe that addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business
including by enhancing customer and associate trust  creating new business opportunities  managing cost and risk  building
capabilities for future advantage and strengthening the underlying systems on which Walmart and our stakeholders rely
We prioritize the ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value: issues that rank high in
relevance to our business and stakeholders and which Walmart is positioned to make a positive impact  Our current ESG
priorities are categorized into four broad themes: opportunity  sustainability  community and ethics and integrity
      •     Opportunity   Retail can be a powerful engine for inclusive economic opportunity  We aim to advance belonging
            diversity  equity and inclusion  and create opportunity for Walmart associates (as further described in the Human
            Capital Management section below)  our suppliers and workers in supply chains  and the communities in which we
            operate  Doing so helps us fulfill our customer mission  strengthens our business and helps people build a better life
            for themselves and their families
      •     Sustainability  Walmart's sustainability efforts focus on our ability to create and preserve long term value for both
            people and planet  With respect to people  our sustainability efforts include sourcing responsibly  helping prevent
            forced labor  empowering women  creating inclusive economic opportunity and selling safer  healthier products  With
            respect to the planet  our efforts aim to enhance the sustainability of product supply chains by reducing emissions
            protecting and restoring nature and reducing waste  To help address the effects of climate change  Walmart has set
            science based targets for emissions reduction  including our goal to achieve zero emissions in our operations by 2040

For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest
possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and
defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for
infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this
pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other
companies making electric vehicles and the world.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital Resources

ESG
        The very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot reduce carbon
emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation
ecosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one,
including with respect to per-unit waste reduction and resource consumption, including water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing
sustainability of operations outside of our direct control, including reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.

        We are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that
ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing
into their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and
external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our
incidents per vehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering compelling,
impactful jobs with best in-industry benefits.

                                                                                                    12 Table of Contents

 holders to use our products at over 100 million acceptance locations worldwide. This network facilitates an efficient, safe and secure
 means for making and receiving payments, a convenient, quick and secure payment method for consumers to access their funds and
 a channel for businesses to receive insight through information that is derived from our network. ee enable transactions for our
 customers through our core payment network in more than 150 currencies and in more than 210 countries and territories.
 Payment Network Transactions. Our core payment network supports what is often referred to as a “four-party” payments network
 and includes the following participantsD account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for
 payment), issuer (the account holder’s financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution).

Interchange fees play a key role in the payment system by reflecting the value that merchants receive from accepting payment products. They are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse them for a portion of the costs incurred in providing services that benefit all participants in the payment network. This includes increased sales for merchants, efficiencies in product delivery, guaranteed payments, and improved customer experiences. Interchange fees help balance the costs and benefits for both consumers and merchants, and they are also a factor in competition among payment providers, influencing transaction volumes and revenues.","The three pillars of the company's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) priorities are People, Prosperity, and Planet.",NYSE_WMT_2024_f2960dd23f014dc2937c80e7852000d5.pdf_37 and NASDAQ_TSLA_2023.pdf_22 and NYSE_MA_2023.pdf_13,2024-09-20 18:29:23

 Data
 ee create a range of products and services for our customers (including the majority of our value-added services) that use our data
 assets, infrastructure, expertise and platforms. These products and services are designed to help reduce fraud, increase security,
 provide actionable insights to our customers to assist in their decision-making and enable our customers to increase their
 engagement with consumers. ee do all this while following our data and tech responsibility principles in how we design, implement
 and deliver those solutions. Our Privacy by Design, Data by Design and AI Governance processes are designed to ensure we embed
 multiple layers of privacy, data protection and information security controls in all of our products and services, keeping a clear focus
 on protecting customers’ and individuals’ data. ee seek to do this in a number of waysD
 •    Practicing data minimization. ee practice collecting and retaining only the personal information that is needed for a given
      product or service, and limiting the amount and type of personal information shared with third parties
 •    Being transparent and providing control. ee explain how we use personal information and AI and give individuals access and
      control over how their data is used and shared
 •    Working with trusted partners. Our processes are designed to ensure we select partners and service providers who share our
      principled-approach to protecting data and using AI
 •    Addressing bias in our data and AI. ee have implemented governance and processes to help test and mitigate for bias when we
      use advanced analytics, including AI and Wachine Learning, to create fair and inclusive solutions that reflect individual, group and
      societal interests
 •    Advancing positive social impact. ehere possible, we utilize our data sets and analytics capabilities to create innovative
      solutions to societal challenges, promoting inclusive financial, social, climate, health and education growth

 Technology
 ee leverage our technology to help enable payments, services and new networks, enhance our operational strength and enable our
 employees to deliver effectively for our customers.

Further, as we acquire new companies and develop integrated and personalized products and services to meet the needs of a
changing marketplace, we have expanded our data profile through additional data types and sources, across multiple channels, and
involving new partners. This expansion has amplified the impact of these various laws and regulations on our business. As a result,
we are required to constantly monitor our data practices and potentially change them when necessary or appropriate. ee also need
to provide increased care in our data management, governance and quality practices, particularly as it relates to the use of data in
products leveraging AI.
New requirements or changing interpretations of existing requirements in these areas, or the development of new regulatory
schemes related to the digital economy in general, may also increase our costs and4or restrict our ability to leverage data or use AI
for innovation. This could impact the products and services we offer and other aspects of our business, such as fraud monitoring,
the need for improved data management, governance and quality practices, the development of information-based products and
solutions, and technology operations. In addition, these requirements may increase the costs to our customers of issuing payment

  Other Regulation
  Regulations that directly or indirectly apply to Mastercard as a result of our participation in the global payments industry may
  materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.
  ee are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many jurisdictions in which our products and services are
  used. Wany of our customers are also subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions that, at times,
  consequently affect us. Such regulation has increased significantly in the last several years (as described in “Business - Government
  Regulation” in Part I, Item 1).

Over the last five years, they have added over $15

the opposite. There will be bumps in the road ahead.
We are still navigating through plenty of bumps right

us confidence in the effectiveness of our strategy —
grounded in and focused on consumers — and an
appreciation for the capability of a talented, creative,
agile and committed organization.

value. We strive to do this in the most responsible
way, consistent with P&G’s Values and Principles.
This approach, with consumers at the center, and an
organization built to serve them, has served us and
our many stakeholders well. It will guide our actions as
we move forward. If we do this effectively, consumers
will benefit, customers will grow their businesses,
employees will develop and thrive, we will have a
positive impact on society, and shareholders will
continue to be rewarded for their investment.
I believe in this Company, in our organization — its

 For the year ended December 31, 2023, net revenue increased 13% versus the comparable period in 2022. On both an as adjusted
 and currency-neutral basis, net revenue increased 13%. The increase in net revenue on both an as reported and as adjusted basis
 was attributable to growth in our payment network and value-added services and solutions.
 Net revenue from our payment network increased 10%, on both an as reported and currency neutral basis, in 2023 versus 2022. The
 increase was primarily driven by growth in domestic and cross-border dollar volumes and an increase in the number of switched
 transactions, reflecting trends of growth in our key drivers. Net revenue from our payment network includes $15,1B2 million of
 rebates and incentives provided to customers, which increased 22% on both an as reported and currency-neutral basis, in 2023

 Net revenue from our value-added services and solutions increased 1B%, or 1A% on a currency-neutral basis, in 2023 versus 2022.

2023 compared with 2022
Net income was $2.8 billion, compared with a net loss of
$743 million in the prior year.

Net revenue was $8.0 billion, compared with $80 million in
the prior year, predominantly driven by higher net interest
income due to higher rates, partially offset by the impact of
lower Firmwide average deposit balances.
Noninterest revenue was $132 million, compared with a
loss of $1.8 billion in the prior year, driven by:
• the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain
   associated with the First Republic acquisition,
• higher losses in the prior year on certain revenues

   associated with foreign exchange rate movements that
   are risk-managed by Treasury and CIO, and

• the impact of higher short-term cash deployment
   activities as a result of the current interest rate
   environment,

partially offset by
• higher net investment securities losses related to the
   sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government
   agency MBS, associated with repositioning the investment
   securities portfolio, and

• lower net gains related to certain other Corporate
   investments.
The prior year included a gain on the sale of Visa B shares
and proceeds from an insurance settlement.

Noninterest expense was $5.6 billion, up $4.6 billion,
predominantly driven by:

• the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment,
• $1.0 billion associated with First Republic, predominantly
   driven by integration and restructuring costs as well as
   expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2023 with
   respect to individuals associated with First Republic who

   did not become employees of the Firm until July 2, 2023,
• a greater benefit in the prior year on certain expenses
   associated with foreign exchange rate movements that
   are risk-managed by Treasury and CIO,
• higher legal expenses, and

• higher costs associated with the Firm's international
   consumer growth initiatives,
partially offset by

• lower benefits-related and real estate expenses.
The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates
associated with the foreign exchange risk that was

transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and
expenses was not material to net income.

We face intense competition in our industry.

       The   global   payments     space    is  intensely   competitive.     As  technology      evolves   and    consumer     expectations
change,    new competitors       or methods      of payment     emerge, and existing        clients and   competitors assume different
roles.  Our products      compete     with cash,    checks, electronic      payments, virtual     currency    payments, global       or multi-
regional   networks,     other  domestic     and   closed-loop    payments      systems,    digital  wallets and     alternative   payments
providers    primarily    focused    on   enabling    payments      through    ecommerce       and    mobile    channels.    As   the   global
payments      space    becomes      more    complex,     we   face   increasing     competition     from   our   clients,  other   emerging
payment      providers    such    as   fintechs,    other   digital  payments,      technology      companies       that  have    developed
payments systems enabled through               online activity in ecommerce,         social media, and mobile channels, as well             as
governments       in  a  number     of  jurisdictions   (e.g.,  Brazil   and   India)   as   discussed     above,    that  are   developing,
supporting and/or operating national schemes, RTP networks and other payment platforms.

       Our  competitors     may    acquire,   develop,    or  make    better   use   of substantially    better   technology,    have    more
widely   adopted delivery channels, or          have greater financial resources. They            may offer    more effective, innovative
or  a  wider  range    of programs,      products    and  services.    They   may    use   more   effective   advertising    and   marketing
strategies    that  result   in broader    brand    recognition,    and    greater   use,   including    with  respect    to  issuance     and
merchant     acceptance. They may          also  develop    better security    solutions    or more favorable       pricing  arrangements.

and Canada. Any future limitations on our business resulting from the outcomes of any litigation
or regulatory proceeding, including any changes to our rules or business practices, could impact our relationships with our
customers, including reducing the volume of business that we do with them, which may materially and adversely affect our overall
business and results of operations.

Business and Operations
Competition and Technology
Substantial and intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall
business and results of operations.
The global payments industry is highly competitive. Our payment programs compete against competitors both within and outside of
the global payments industry and compete in all payment categories, including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic
payments. ee compete against general purpose payments networks, debit and local networks, ACR and real-time account-based
payments systems, digital wallets and other fintechs (focused on online activity across various channels and processing payments
using in-house capabilities), government-backed networks and digital currencies. ee also face competition from companies that
provide alternatives to our value-added services and new adjacent network capabilities (including open banking and digital identity).
Our traditional competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a wider range of
programs, services, and payment capabilities than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to
achieve broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we have.                                    They may also introduce their own innovative
programs, value-added services and capabilities that adversely impact our growth.
Certain of our competitors to our core payment network operate three-party payments systems with direct connections to both
merchants and consumers, potentially providing competitive advantages. If we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than
these competitors because we operate a four-party system, or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which
our competitors are not, we could lose business to these competitors. See “Business - Competition” in Part I, Item 1.
Certain of our competitors have developed alternative payments systems, e-commerce payments systems and payments systems for
mobile devices, as well as physical store locations. A number of these competitors rely principally on technology to support their
services that provides cost advantages, and as a result may enjoy lower costs than we do. Wany of these competitors are also able
to use existing payment networks without being subject to many of the associated costs.

In the retail industry, we believe a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence are
having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including Wastercard. Some large merchants have
supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Wastercard has been defending, including the c.S.
merchant litigations. Some merchants are increasingly asking regulators to review and potentially regulate our own network fees, in
addition to interchange. See “Risk Factors – Payments Industry Regulation” in this Part I, Item 1A. The continued focus of merchants
on the costs of accepting various forms of payment (including digital) may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings.
Certain larger merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer
customers as a condition to accepting our products. ee also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create co-
branded payment programs with us. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of
incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive
and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. Additionally, if the rate of
merchant acceptance growth slows, our business could suffer.
Our work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of
operations.
As we increase our work with national, state and local governments, both indirectly through financial institutions and with them
directly as our customers, we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments. These risks
include, but are not limited to, the followingD
•   Governmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. Changes in governmental priorities or other political
    developments, including disruptions in governmental operations, could impact approved funding and result in changes in the
    scope, or lead to the termination, of the arrangements or contracts we or financial institutions enter into with respect to our
    payment products and services.
•   Our work with governments is heavily regulated, subjecting us to additional potential exposure under c.S. and international anti-
    corruption laws (including the c.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the c.U. Bribery Act), as well as compliance with various
    procurement and other laws, regulations, standards and contract terms.

UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY  25             WHAT WE LEARNED: A FIVE-POINT ACTION PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD
            ON THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE

In May 2023, we gathered with knowledgeable and influential
people from the energy industry writ large to the government
and financial services arena in Scottsdale, Arizona, for an
action forum. The goal was to explore various aspects of the
climate challenge and try to devise effective solutions that
could help lead to meaningful progress. The climate challenge
is immense and complex. Addressing it requires more than
making simplistic statements and rules; rather, energy
systems and global supply chains need to be transformed
across virtually all industries. And there is also a deep need
for new research and development. Energy systems and
supply chains provide the foundation of the global economy
and must be treated with care.
•  Public/private partnerships in scaling bankable projects.
   Scaling investments needs to happen both for commercially
   proven technologies (e.g., wind and solar) and for emerging
   technologies (e.g., green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel
   and carbon capture). Developing “bankable” clean energy
   projects will require the application of smart financial tools,
   as well as further policy support. It will take public/private
   partnerships and innovation to create catalytic forms of
   capital that can step into these gaps, absorb first-mover
   risks and provide the necessary funding. The cost of capital
   is too high for some companies — and public funds ought
   to be deployed in a smart way that effectively attracts
   private capital.

At the same time, the opportunity here is immense. The
investment required to meet climate goals — estimated at over
$5 trillion annually — could generate economywide growth and
opportunity at a scale the world has not seen since the
Industrial Revolution.

The task for industry, policymakers and finance is to help
formulate solutions that support the transition to a low-carbon
economy, balancing affordable, reliable access to energy with
generating economic growth.
To find a way forward, we sought input from diverse
stakeholders in pursuit of a North Star.

1. **Intense Competition**: The global payments space is highly competitive, with numerous competitors emerging as technology evolves and consumer expectations change. This includes competition from cash, checks, electronic payments, virtual currencies, digital wallets, and fintechs.

2. **Technological Advancements**: Competitors may develop or acquire superior technology, leading to better delivery channels and more effective services. This can result in a competitive disadvantage for companies that cannot keep pace with technological innovations.

3. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Companies in the payments industry may face increased regulatory scrutiny, especially if they operate under a four-party system compared to competitors with three-party systems. This could lead to potential business losses.

4. **Merchant Influence**: Larger merchants are increasingly impacting the payments industry by challenging interchange fees and negotiating better terms, which could affect profitability and operational results.

5. **Government Contracts**: Working with government entities introduces risks related to funding changes, political developments, and compliance with various laws and regulations, which could impact business operations.

6. **Pricing Pressures**: Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing may make it difficult to offset costs associated with incentives provided to merchants, potentially affecting overall business performance.

The following discussion provides a description of the impact
on a fair value measurement of a change in each
unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship
between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant.
The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a
change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change
in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist
between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are
discussed below. Relationships may also exist between
observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as
observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment
rates decline); such relationships have not been included in
the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual
relationships described below, the inverse relationship would
also generally apply.
The following discussion also provides a description of
attributes of the underlying instruments and external market
factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of
the Firm’s positions.
Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to
discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow
calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result
in a decrease in a fair value measurement.
Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional
annualized return over the market interest rate that a market
participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit
risk of an instrument.

For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United
States, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such
data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, although the CJEU upheld the
validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the Irish Data Protection
Committee (IDPC) issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic
Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine
of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into
compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the United States. We are appealing this decision and
the corrective orders are currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court. Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States
announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden
signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and
the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General as a ""qualifying state"" under Section 3(f) of the E.O.
On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United

          similarly offer forms of patent term restoration. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates are
          available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap
          from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval) and in Japan patent terms can be extended up to five
          years.
In some cases, the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic, biosimilar, or other
follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through market dynamics
and challenges, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data
protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. The primary forms of data protection are
as follows:
     •    Data package protection generally prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications
          for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for the drug.
          The base period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics under the BPCIA, subject
          to certain conditions), effectively 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the
          date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patents.
     •    In the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the
          sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric populations within a specified time period. If granted, this
          ""pediatric exclusivity"" provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added to the term of data
          protection, orphan drug exclusivity and, for products other than biologics, to the term of any relevant and
          non-expired patents.
     •    A specific use of a drug or biologic can receive ""orphan"" designation in the U.S. if it is intended to treat a
          disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or where it is not reasonably
          expected to recover development and marketing costs through U.S. sales.

calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase
grants RSUs to certain employees under its share-based
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period
on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of
common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition

        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been signed by the following persons on behalf
of the Registrant in the capacities indicated and on the dates indicated.

For instance, our total revenue increased 17%, 16%, and 16% between the
third and fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021 declined 11%, 17%, and 7%
compared to the fourth quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.

         Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue

         Changes in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our total revenue in the full year 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. If we had
translated revenue for the full year 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our
total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $134.53 billion and $131.57 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and
advertising revenue would have been $374 million and $379 million lower than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year
2023. Using the same constant rates, full year 2023 total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $17.92 billion and $17.93 billion higher than actual
total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2022.

         Cost of revenue in 2023 increased $710 million, or 3%, compared to 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher operational expenses related to
our data centers and technical infrastructure, partially offset by a decrease in data center abandonment charges related to restructuring and lower content costs.

money laundering (“AWL”) and countering the financing of terrorism (“CFT”) laws and regulations globally, including the c.S. Bank

comprised of policies, procedures and internal controls, including the designation of a compliance officer, which is designed to
prevent our payments network from being used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activity and to address these legal and

administered by OFAC restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies (specifically Crimea,

          similarly offer forms of patent term restoration. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates are
          available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap
          from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval) and in Japan patent terms can be extended up to five
          years.
In some cases, the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic, biosimilar, or other
follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through market dynamics
and challenges, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data
protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. The primary forms of data protection are
as follows:
     •    Data package protection generally prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications
          for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for the drug.
          The base period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics under the BPCIA, subject
          to certain conditions), effectively 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the
          date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patents.
     •    In the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the
          sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric populations within a specified time period. If granted, this
          ""pediatric exclusivity"" provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added to the term of data
          protection, orphan drug exclusivity and, for products other than biologics, to the term of any relevant and
          non-expired patents.
     •    A specific use of a drug or biologic can receive ""orphan"" designation in the U.S. if it is intended to treat a
          disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or where it is not reasonably
          expected to recover development and marketing costs through U.S. sales.

Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption. ee are subject to anti-
money laundering (“AWL”) and countering the financing of terrorism (“CFT”) laws and regulations globally, including the c.S. Bank
Secrecy Act and the cSA PATRIOT Act, as well as the various economic sanctions programs, including those imposed and
administered by the c.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). ee have implemented a comprehensive AWL4CFT program,
comprised of policies, procedures and internal controls, including the designation of a compliance officer, which is designed to
prevent our payments network from being used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activity and to address these legal and
regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The economic sanctions programs
administered by OFAC restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies (specifically Crimea,
the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of ckraine, Cuba, Iran, North Uorea and Syria) and with
persons and entities included in OFAC sanctions lists including its list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the
“SDN List”).

                                                                          9           expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from FDA approval. Some countries outside the U.S.
          similarly offer forms of patent term restoration. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates are
          available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap
          from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval) and in Japan patent terms can be extended up to five
          years.
In some cases, the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic, biosimilar, or other
follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through market dynamics
and challenges, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data
protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. The primary forms of data protection are
as follows:
     •    Data package protection generally prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications
          for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company's regulatory submission data for the drug.
          The base period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics under the BPCIA, subject
          to certain conditions), effectively 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the
          date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patents.
     •    In the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the
          sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric populations within a specified time period. If granted, this
          ""pediatric exclusivity"" provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added to the term of data
          protection, orphan drug exclusivity and, for products other than biologics, to the term of any relevant and
          non-expired patents.
     •    A specific use of a drug or biologic can receive ""orphan"" designation in the U.S. if it is intended to treat a
          disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or where it is not reasonably
          expected to recover development and marketing costs through U.S. sales.

E-mail that has no business value at all and should not be retained – such as e-mail confirming lunch dates. Employees are already familiar with the requirement to clean out their mailbox. Employees should regularly delete e-mail that no longer has business value (assuming there is no legal hold on the e-mail and that it does not relate to a pending or threatened litigation or investigation). An efficient way to deal with e-mail that qualifies as a record, is to create personal folders with descriptive names that correspond to projects or to record categories typically used by each employees, including the month and year in which the folder was created. E-mail that needs to be retained as a business record can be moved into the appropriate folder and taken back-up of. (It is important that this part of the policy is read with the advisory/guidelines issued by IT department on preservation of e-mails, from time to time.) 3.7 Business data in electronic form a) JDE Data on AS400 CIL works on JDE ERP / Keris Template from 1996.

Introduction
HR policies are continuing guidelines on how people should be managed in the organization.
They define the philosophies and values of the organization on how people should be treated,
and from these are derived the principles upon which managers are expected to act when
dealing with HR matters. HR policies should be distinguished from procedures, as discussed
in Chapter 61. A policy provides generalized guidance on how HR issues should be dealt with;
a procedure spells out precisely what steps should be taken to deal with major employment
issues such as grievances, discipline, capability and redundancy.

Why have HR policies?
HR policies provide guidelines on how key aspects of people management should be handled.
The aim is to ensure that any HR issues are dealt with consistently in accordance with the
values of the organization in line with certain defined principles. All organizations have HR
policies. Some, however, exist implicitly as a philosophy of management and an attitude to
employees that is expressed in the way in which HR issues are handled; for example, the intro-
duction of new technology. The advantage of explicit policies in terms of consistency and
understanding may appear to be obvious, but there are disadvantages: written policies can be
inflexible, constrictive, platitudinous, or all three. To a degree, policies have often to be
expressed in abstract terms and managers do not care for abstractions. But they do want to
know where they stand – people like structure – and formalized HR policies can provide the
guidelines they need.
Formalized HR policies can be used in induction, team leader and management training to
help participants understand the philosophies and values of the organization and how they are
expected to behave within that context. They are a means for defining the employment rela-
tionship and the psychological contract.
HR policies can be expressed formally as overall statements of the values of the organization
or in specific areas, as discussed in this chapter.

Overall HR policy
The overall HR policy defines how the organization fulfils its social responsibilities to its
employees and sets out its attitudes towards them.

Line managers have an impor-
           tant role in doing this. As pointed out by Purcell et al (2003) ‘there is a need for HR policies to
           be designed for and focused on front line managers’. It is they who will be largely responsible
           for policy implementation. Members of the HR function can give guidance, but it is line man-
           agers who are on the spot and have to make decisions about people. The role of HR is to com-
           municate and interpret the policies, convince line managers that they are necessary, and
           provide training and support that will equip managers to implement them. As Purcell et al
           (2003) emphasize, it is line managers who bring HR policies to life.

             HR policies – key learning points

The reasons for having HR policies
HR policies provide guidelines on how key
aspects of people management should be
handled. The aim is to ensure that any HR
issues are dealt with consistently in accord-
ance with the values of the organization in
line with certain defined principles.
Overall HR policy
The overall HR policy defines how the
organization fulfils its social responsibili-
ties for its employees and sets out its atti-
tudes towards them. It is an expression of
its  values    or   beliefs   about    how    people
should be treated.

Specifi c HR policies
Specific HR policies cover age and employ-
ment, AIDS, bullying, discipline, e-mails
and the internet, employee development,
employee        relations,      employee       voice,
employment,         equal    opportunity,      griev-
ances, health and safety, managing diver-
sity, promotion, redundancy, reward, sexual
harassment, substance abuse and work–life
balance.
Formulating HR policies
HR policies need to address the key HR
issues    that   have   been    identified    in   the
organization. They must also take account
of external influences such as legislation.
The    maximum        amount      of   consultation
should take place with managers, employ-
ees and their representatives, and the poli-
cies should be communicated widely with
guidelines on their application.
Implementing HR policies
The aim will be to implement policies fairly
and consistently. Line managers have a key
role in doing this.                                                                                                        HR Policies  999

   Questions

   1.    What are HR policies?
   2.

They are a means for defining the employment rela-
tionship and the psychological contract.
HR policies can be expressed formally as overall statements of the values of the organization
or in specific areas, as discussed in this chapter.

Overall HR policy
The overall HR policy defines how the organization fulfils its social responsibilities to its
employees and sets out its attitudes towards them. It is an expression of its values or beliefs
about how people should be treated. Peters and Waterman (1982) wrote that if they were asked
for one all-purpose bit of advice for management, one truth that they could distil from all their
research on what makes an organization excellent, it would be: ‘Figure out your value system.
Decide what the organization stands for.’                                                                                                     HR Policies  989

Selznick (1957) emphasized the key role of values in organizations when he wrote: ‘The forma-
tion of an institution is marked by the making of value commitments, that is, choices which fix
the assumptions of policy makers as to the nature of the enterprise, its distinctive aims, methods
and roles.’
The values expressed in an overall statement of HR policies may explicitly or implicitly refer to
the following concepts.

     Values expressed in overall HR policy
       •     Equity – treating employees fairly and justly by adopting an ‘even-handed’
             approach. This includes protecting individuals from any unfair decisions made
             by their managers, providing equal opportunities for employment and promo-

The aim will be to implement policies fairly
and consistently. Line managers have a key
role in doing this.                                                                                                        HR Policies  999

Introduction to the Template
and Human Resource Policies

Objectives of the Template
This template is provided as a tool for community foundations to develop policies on all matters related to
conditions of employment. There are parts of this policy which also apply to volunteers and individuals working on
contract. Those policies that do not apply to volunteers and contractors will be so noted at the beginning of each
policy.

Employment-related legislation is a provincial responsibility. All parts of this document are supplementary to
applicable federal and provincial legislation. In the event of conflict, such legislation will prevail. Appendix A
provides links to legislation in each province and territory. There will be references throughout this document
where it is necessary to adapt this policy to align with said legislation.

There will also be notations throughout this policy where local community foundation specific information needs to
be inserted.

At the beginning of each policy there is a shaded text box that provides rationale as to why the policy is important,
especially from a risk mitigation perspective. The box also includes guidance on adapting the policy for your
foundation’s use. When developing your foundation’s policies, these text boxes can be removed, unless you would
like to include them as part of the rationale for each of the policies.

For some community foundations, the senior staff member is the Executive Director (ED) and for others the title is
Chief Executive Officer (CEO).","HR policies are important because they provide guidelines on how key aspects of people management should be handled.

human_resources_documents,what are methods of destruction,"Retain FC&A approval’s to destroy Records at your end. 7.2 Destroying Procedures Records Management staff / third party service provider will provide listings to each functions indicating records held in Records storage facilities that are eligible for destruction. It is the responsibility of each functional unit to timely review these listings to ensure that no records slated for destruction are subject to existing law or tax laws. The Legal and Tax Department will also review the destruction listings for records that may be subject to holds. Records will not be destroyed without approval of functional team leader and/or Legal, Tax Departments in accordance with this Policy. Documentation of proof of destruction shall be maintained by each function. 7.3 Removing Records for Destruction On-site Records that are approved for destruction shall be removed from their filing location and brought to a staging area. The Records Coordinator or other authorized person shall verify that the Records correspond to those identified in the list of Destruction Form. 7.4 Methods of Destruction There are three recommended methods of Records destruction: Shredding: Cut Records with a mechanical shredder before releasing for destruction. Recycle: Deposit the Records in Company containers or bags to process in order to regain material to be used again Waste Paper: Discard with department (In Mumbai, we have an agency called Salvation Army) One may use any of the above methods depending on the nature of records. 7.5 Establishing “holds” on Records Records that are subject to existing (and potential) court and administrative orders in litigation, governmental proceedings or investigations, audits or are otherwise identified as not for destruction for business reasons cannot be destroyed even when permitted by Retention Schedule, such Records will be kept “on hold”. No records subject to a “hold” will be considered for destruction until the “hold” is removed. For this reason, no records subject to a “hold” should appear on a list of Destruction form. The functional head placing the “hold” on the records will promptly notify the Records Coordinator / third party service provider by e-mail when a “hold” can be released. The Legal / Tax Department is responsible to advise on determining the scope of the litigation or other adversarial action, or investigation where the Legal / Tax Department is providing counsel and communicating this information to the Records Coordinator / third service provider. Hold lists will be generated periodically by Records Coordinator / third party service provider for functional team review.

d) Sales Tax / VAT - Under various state VAT/Sales Tax Act the records are required to be retained for a period of 8 years from the end of the of the relevant financial year. Further the records are required to be maintained where there are ongoing litigation and should be retained till 3 years after end of litigation. e) Every statute usually lays down the time period for which documents need to be stored. Else the general limitation period under the Law of Limitations would apply. Each function should decide the time period for which such non statutory records needs to be retained based on available place & business requirements. 6. 7. RECORDS DESTRUCTION PROCEDURE 7.1 Destroying Records Records will be destroyed in accordance with the terms of the Policy in the normal course of business after the applicable retention period has expired and with approval from SPA. Proper destruction of active and inactive records is the responsibility of each functional team. As established retention period expires, Records will be destroyed on an ongoing basis to prevent excessive accumulation and eliminate unnecessary costs of managing obsolete Records. Each functional team is responsible for at least once a year to verify that Records are being managed in accordance with the Policy. Steps to be followed for Records Destruction: 1. Check with the Policy / Retention Schedule. 2. If it exceeds retention period, Records Coordinator to prepare a list of Records to be destroyed. 3. Records Coordinator to take his SPA’s approval to destroy Records. 4. On receipt of approval from SPA, Records coordinator to send the list of Records to be destroyed to FC&A. 5. FC&A will take clearance from Tax / Legal Department. 6. FC&A will send a formal sign off to destroy Records or reject proposal to destroy Records. 7. If proposal is approved to destroy Records, Records coordinator to arrange for Records to be destroyed. 8. Retain FC&A approval’s to destroy Records at your end. 7.2 Destroying Procedures Records Management staff / third party service provider will provide listings to each functions indicating records held in Records storage facilities that are eligible for destruction. It is the responsibility of each functional unit to timely review these listings to ensure that no records slated for destruction are subject to existing law or tax laws. The Legal and Tax Department will also review the destruction listings for records that may be subject to holds.

Introduction
HR policies are continuing guidelines on how people should be managed in the organization.
They define the philosophies and values of the organization on how people should be treated,
and from these are derived the principles upon which managers are expected to act when
dealing with HR matters. HR policies should be distinguished from procedures, as discussed
in Chapter 61. A policy provides generalized guidance on how HR issues should be dealt with;
a procedure spells out precisely what steps should be taken to deal with major employment
issues such as grievances, discipline, capability and redundancy.

Why have HR policies?
HR policies provide guidelines on how key aspects of people management should be handled.
The aim is to ensure that any HR issues are dealt with consistently in accordance with the
values of the organization in line with certain defined principles. All organizations have HR
policies. Some, however, exist implicitly as a philosophy of management and an attitude to
employees that is expressed in the way in which HR issues are handled; for example, the intro-
duction of new technology. The advantage of explicit policies in terms of consistency and
understanding may appear to be obvious, but there are disadvantages: written policies can be
inflexible, constrictive, platitudinous, or all three. To a degree, policies have often to be
expressed in abstract terms and managers do not care for abstractions. But they do want to
know where they stand – people like structure – and formalized HR policies can provide the
guidelines they need.
Formalized HR policies can be used in induction, team leader and management training to
help participants understand the philosophies and values of the organization and how they are
expected to behave within that context. They are a means for defining the employment rela-
tionship and the psychological contract.
HR policies can be expressed formally as overall statements of the values of the organization
or in specific areas, as discussed in this chapter.

Overall HR policy
The overall HR policy defines how the organization fulfils its social responsibilities to its
employees and sets out its attitudes towards them.

Line managers have an impor-
           tant role in doing this. As pointed out by Purcell et al (2003) ‘there is a need for HR policies to
           be designed for and focused on front line managers’. It is they who will be largely responsible
           for policy implementation. Members of the HR function can give guidance, but it is line man-
           agers who are on the spot and have to make decisions about people. The role of HR is to com-
           municate and interpret the policies, convince line managers that they are necessary, and
           provide training and support that will equip managers to implement them. As Purcell et al
           (2003) emphasize, it is line managers who bring HR policies to life.

             HR policies – key learning points

The reasons for having HR policies
HR policies provide guidelines on how key
aspects of people management should be
handled. The aim is to ensure that any HR
issues are dealt with consistently in accord-
ance with the values of the organization in
line with certain defined principles.
Overall HR policy
The overall HR policy defines how the
organization fulfils its social responsibili-
ties for its employees and sets out its atti-
tudes towards them. It is an expression of
its  values    or   beliefs   about    how    people
should be treated.

Specifi c HR policies
Specific HR policies cover age and employ-
ment, AIDS, bullying, discipline, e-mails
and the internet, employee development,
employee        relations,      employee       voice,
employment,         equal    opportunity,      griev-
ances, health and safety, managing diver-
sity, promotion, redundancy, reward, sexual
harassment, substance abuse and work–life
balance.
Formulating HR policies
HR policies need to address the key HR
issues    that   have   been    identified    in   the
organization. They must also take account
of external influences such as legislation.
The    maximum        amount      of   consultation
should take place with managers, employ-
ees and their representatives, and the poli-
cies should be communicated widely with
guidelines on their application.
Implementing HR policies
The aim will be to implement policies fairly
and consistently. Line managers have a key
role in doing this.                                                                                                        HR Policies  999

They are a means for defining the employment rela-
tionship and the psychological contract.
HR policies can be expressed formally as overall statements of the values of the organization
or in specific areas, as discussed in this chapter.

Overall HR policy
The overall HR policy defines how the organization fulfils its social responsibilities to its
employees and sets out its attitudes towards them. It is an expression of its values or beliefs
about how people should be treated. Peters and Waterman (1982) wrote that if they were asked
for one all-purpose bit of advice for management, one truth that they could distil from all their
research on what makes an organization excellent, it would be: ‘Figure out your value system.
Decide what the organization stands for.’                                                                                                     HR Policies  989

Selznick (1957) emphasized the key role of values in organizations when he wrote: ‘The forma-
tion of an institution is marked by the making of value commitments, that is, choices which fix
the assumptions of policy makers as to the nature of the enterprise, its distinctive aims, methods
and roles.’
The values expressed in an overall statement of HR policies may explicitly or implicitly refer to
the following concepts.

     Values expressed in overall HR policy
       •     Equity – treating employees fairly and justly by adopting an ‘even-handed’
             approach. This includes protecting individuals from any unfair decisions made
             by their managers, providing equal opportunities for employment and promo-
             tion, and operating an equitable payment system.
       •     Consideration – taking account of individual circumstances when making deci-
             sions that affect the prospects, security or self-respect of employees.
       •     Organizational learning – a belief in the need to promote the learning and devel-
             opment of all the members of the organization by providing the processes and
             support required.
       •     Performance through people – the importance attached to developing a per-
             formance culture and to continuous improvement; the significance of perform-
             ance management as a means of defining and agreeing mutual expectations; the
             provision of fair feedback to people on how well they are performing.
       •     Quality of working life – consciously and continually aiming to improve the
             quality of working life.

The    maximum        amount      of   consultation
should take place with managers, employ-
ees and their representatives, and the poli-
cies should be communicated widely with
guidelines on their application.

They ensure that HR issues are dealt with consistently in accordance with the organization's values and defined principles. Additionally, HR policies help define the employment relationship and the psychological contract, guiding managers in their interactions with employees. Overall, they contribute to a structured approach to managing human resources, which can enhance fairness, consideration, and organizational learning within the workplace.",60 - HR Politicies.pdf_1 and 60 - HR Politicies.pdf_13 and 60 - HR Politicies.pdf_2 and 60 - HR Politicies.pdf_14 and HR-Guide_-Policy-and-Procedure-Template.pdf_2,2024-09-26 14:40:58
human_resources_documents,what is marriage policy,"The policy could be set out as follows:
 •     We are an equal opportunity employer. This means that we do not permit direct or
       indirect discrimination against any employee on the grounds of race, nationality, sex,
       sexual orientation, disability, religion, marital status or age.
 •     Direct discrimination takes place when a person is treated less favourably than others
       are, or would be, treated in similar circumstances.
 •     Indirect discrimination takes place when, whether intentional or not, a condition is
       applied that adversely affects a considerable proportion of people of one race, national-
       ity, sex, sexual orientation, religion or marital status, or those with disabilities or older
       employees.
 •     The firm will ensure that equal opportunity principles are applied in all its HR policies
       and in particular to the procedures relating to the recruitment, training, development
       and promotion of its employees. 994     HR Policies, Procedures and Systems

  •    Where appropriate and where permissible under the relevant legislation and codes of
       practice, employees of under-represented groups will be given positive training and
       encouragement to achieve equal opportunity.

Grievances
The policy on grievances could state that employees have the right to raise their grievances
with their manager, to be accompanied by a representative if they so wish, and to appeal to a
higher level if they feel that their grievance has not been resolved satisfactorily. The policy
should be supported by a grievance procedure (see Chapter 61).

Health and safety
Health and safety policies cover how the organization intends to provide healthy and safe
places and systems of work (see Chapter 58).

New technology
A new technology policy statement could state that there will be consultation about the intro-
duction of new technology and the steps that would be taken by the organization to minimize
the risk of compulsory redundancy or adverse effects on other terms and conditions or working
arrangements.

Promotion
A promotion policy could state the organization’s intention to promote from within wherever
this is appropriate as a means of satisfying its requirements for high-quality staff. The policy
could, however, recognize that there will be occasions when the organization’s present and
future needs can only be met by recruitment from outside. The point could be made that a
vigorous organization needs infusions of fresh blood from time to time if it is not to stagnate.

A management of diversity policy could: 992      HR Policies, Procedures and Systems

  •     acknowledge cultural and individual differences in the workplace;
  •     state that the organization values the different qualities that people bring to their jobs;
  •     emphasize the need to eliminate bias in such areas as selection, promotion, perform-
        ance assessment, pay and learning opportunities;
  •     focus attention on individual differences rather than group differences.

E-mails and use of the internet
The policy on e-mails could state that the sending or downloading of offensive e-mails is pro-
hibited and that the senders or downloaders of such messages are subject to normal discipli-
nary procedures. They may also prohibit any internet browsing or downloading of material
not related to the business, although this can be difficult to enforce. Some companies have
always believed that reasonable use of the telephone is acceptable, and that policy may be
extended to the internet.
If it is decided that employees’ e-mails should be monitored to check on excessive or unaccept-
able use, this should be included in an e-mail policy, which would therefore be part of the con-
tractual arrangements. A policy statement could be included to the effect that: ‘The company
reserves the right to access and monitor all e-mail messages created, sent, received or stored on
the company’s system.’

Employee development
The employee development policy could express the organization’s commitment to the con-
tinuous development of the skills and abilities of employees in order to maximize their contri-
bution and to give them the opportunity to enhance their skills, realize their potential, advance
their careers and increase their employability both within and outside the organization.

Employee relations
The employee relations policy will set out the organization’s approach to the rights of employees
to have their interests represented to management through trade unions, staff associations or
some other form of representative system. It will also cover the basis upon which the organiza-
tion works with trade unions, eg emphasizing that this should be regarded as a partnership.

Employee voice
The employee voice policy should spell out the organization’s belief in giving employees an
opportunity to have a say in matters that affect them. It should define the mechanisms for
employee voice such as joint consultation and suggestion schemes.                                                                                                     HR Policies  993

tionship.

behavior and outcomes from the employee.

The Promotion Policy is a step in the direction of developing a comprehensive human resource
framework for the Institute. The Promotion Policy is one of the components of that framework

programme and link them with the promotion. As promotion is a process of reward, incentive,
encouragement, appreciation of very good performance and enabling personal growth of an
employee, it is important that the Institute takes up the responsibility of institutionalizing staff
development and training so that the aspiration of the employee is balanced with the interest of
the Institute.

     Sr.","Mobile reimbursement refers to the financial support provided by the Institute to employees for the purchase and usage of mobile phones. Key points include:

1. Employees can buy mobile phones above the eligible limit, but the Institute will reimburse only up to the eligible limit.
2. Certain employees must obtain prior approval for mobile phone facilities.
3. If an employee leaves the Institute within one to three years, a percentage of the reimbursement will be recovered.
4. New mobile phone purchases are allowed only after three years, and if a phone is lost or broken within that period, the employee bears the repair or replacement costs.
5. Upon retirement, employees can keep their mobile phones, but reimbursement amounts will still be recovered based on the duration of employment.
6. The Institute covers monthly mobile usage up to a specified limit, with any excess costs being the employee's responsibility. 

Reimbursement amounts vary by employee level, with specific monthly limits outlined in the policy.",HR Policy Manual 2023 IIM.pdf_191 and HR_Policy-GGIAL.pdf_17 and HR Policy Manual 2023 IIM.pdf_164,2024-09-27 12:18:12
